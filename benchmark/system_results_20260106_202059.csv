Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual approaches, and highlights the potential of AI-driven methods and the OWASP ASVS framework to address these gaps in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process. This approach enables the\nearly identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, which is both more effi-\n1 https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching. For the model suite,\nthey prioritized architectures with advanced reasoning capabilities, hypothe-\nsizing that these specific technical features are essential for the multi-step de-\nduction required in security requirements engineering.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Security Frameworks and Related Datasets**: This section contrasts various security frameworks, highlighting the suitability of OWASP ASVS for fine-grained security requirement classification, and reviews existing security-related datasets, emphasizing their limitations and relevance to automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:']","The primary motivation for integrating security during the requirements analysis phase is to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulnerabilities, and minimize the high costs associated with downstream remediation.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Discussion on Model Evaluation and Challenges in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk focuses on the challenges of reproducibility and class imbalance in model evaluation, the use of experimental LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and classification performance, highlighting insights from fine-tuned BERT models and LLM prompting strategies.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.']","The manual identification of security requirements is described as challenging due to several factors:

1. **Implicit Nature of Security Requirements**: Security requirements are often embedded implicitly within functional requirements, making them difficult to identify without specialized expertise. For example, a simple requirement like ""The system will allow the user to print documents"" carries implicit security needs such as verifying user authorization, maintaining session validity, and recording actions for accountability. These dependencies span multiple security control areas, such as access control, session management, and logging, which are complex to manually identify and validate.

2. **Error-Prone and Inconsistent Process**: Manually identifying implicit security dependencies across thousands of requirements is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and lacks scalability. This is especially problematic in large-scale software systems where security concerns are deeply intertwined with functional requirements.

3. **Subjectivity and Expertise Dependency**: The process relies heavily on domain-specific expertise, which introduces subjectivity and potential bias. Security requirements often depend on latent knowledge and industry experience rather than explicit indicators in the text, making manual classification inconsistent across different annotators.

4. **Dataset Limitations**: The scarcity and limited quality of domain-specific annotated datasets further exacerbate the challenge. Existing datasets, such as PROMISE exp, DOSSPRE, and the Healthcare dataset, lack sufficient granularity, realism, or diversity to support reliable manual identification and validation of security requirements.

5. **Class Imbalance**: Security requirements datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where certain security categories (e.g., cryptographic storage) are underrepresented compared to others (e.g., authentication). This imbalance makes manual identification even more difficult, as rare security concerns are harder to detect and classify accurately.

These challenges highlight the need for automated approaches, such as AI-driven methods and frameworks like OWASP ASVS, to address the limitations of manual Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Overview of ASRD Dataset and Research Questions**: This chunk introduces the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS categories.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4. Randomization: The remaining requirements were randomized and masked\nto mitigate potential annotation bias related to the document source or the\nsequence of requirements.\nThe resulting ASRD comprises 2,652 well-formed functional requirements\nacross six distinct business areas: Construction (1,202), Legal (177), Education\n(312), Software (199), Meeting (126), and Accommodation (636).

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements."", 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017).

In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers.

Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation.

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

Each requirement can be mapped to more than one classes.\nTable 3: OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 Classes\nClass Id Class Name Definition\nV1 Architecture, Design and\nThreat Modeling\nThis class focuses on the security of the\napplication’s architecture, component\ndesign, and the process of identifying\nand mitigating threats throughout the\ndevelopment lifecycle.\nV2 Authentication This class deals with verifying the\nidentity of users, services, or applica-\ntions, ensuring that only authorized\nentities can access specific functionali-\nties or data.\nV3 Session Management This class covers the secure manage-\nment of user sessions, from creation\nto termination, including protection of\nsession identifiers and prevention of\nsession-related attacks.\nV4 Access Control This class ensures that users can only\naccess the data and functions for which\nthey are explicitly authorized, enforc-\ning the principle of least privilege.', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk provides detailed definitions of security requirement classes (V5–V14) from the OWASP ASVS taxonomy, which are central to the classification and verification of security requirements in the study, emphasizing their role in mitigating specific vulnerabilities across software systems.\n\nCONTENT: 14 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 3 – continued from previous page\nClass Id Class Name Definition\nV5 Malicious Input Handling This class focuses on requirements\nfor validating and sanitizing all input\ndata to prevent injection attacks, such\nas SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting\n(XSS), and others.\nV6 Stored Cryptography This class addresses the secure stor-\nage of cryptographic keys and sensi-\ntive data at rest, ensuring they are pro-\ntected from unauthorized disclosure or\nmodification.\nV7 Error Handling and Logging This class ensures that applications\nhandle errors gracefully without leak-\ning sensitive information and that\nsecurity-relevant events are logged for\nmonitoring and analysis.\nV8 Data Protection This class covers the requirements for\nprotecting sensitive data during tran-\nsit and in storage, focusing on confi-\ndentiality, integrity, and classification.\nV9 Communications Security This class focuses on securing commu-\nnication channels between system com-\nponents, such as between the client and\nserver, to prevent eavesdropping, tam-\npering, or spoofing.\nV10 Malicious Code This class deals with ensuring the ap-\nplication code is free from malicious\ncode, backdoors, or other unintended\nsecurity vulnerabilities introduced in-\ntentionally or unintentionally.\nV11 Business Logic This class addresses security con-\ncerns within the application’s business\nlogic, preventing attackers from abus-\ning workflows or functionalities for un-\nintended purposes.\nV12 File and Resources This class covers the secure handling of\nfiles and other resources, including up-\nload, download, and management, to\nprevent path traversal and other re-\nlated attacks.\nV13 API and Web Service This class provides security require-\nments specifically for APIs and web\nservices, covering aspects like authen-\ntication, authorization, and protection\nagainst common API attacks.\nV14 Configuration This class focuses on securing the con-\nfiguration of all application compo-\nnents, including the application server,\nplatform, and third-party libraries, to\nprevent security misconfigurations.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Model Comparison**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of various models across OWASP ASVS security classes, highlighting challenges with sparse categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, Files and Resources) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and generalizability concerns.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95. These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', ""CONTEXT: **Dataset Curation and Sampling for ASRD**: This chunk details the filtering, randomization, and sampling processes used to curate the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), ensuring high-quality, representative Turkish-language functional requirements across six business domains, with examples provided to illustrate the dataset's scope and alignment with OWASP ASVS security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 10 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n3. Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4. Randomization: The remaining requirements were randomized and masked\nto mitigate potential annotation bias related to the document source or the\nsequence of requirements.\nThe resulting ASRD comprises 2,652 well-formed functional requirements\nacross six distinct business areas: Construction (1,202), Legal (177), Education\n(312), Software (199), Meeting (126), and Accommodation (636).

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual approaches, and highlights the potential of AI-driven methods and the OWASP ASVS framework to address these gaps in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Security Frameworks and Related Datasets**: This section contrasts various security frameworks, highlighting the suitability of OWASP ASVS for fine-grained security requirement classification, and reviews existing security-related datasets, emphasizing their limitations and relevance to automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Model Comparison**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of various models across OWASP ASVS security classes, highlighting challenges with sparse categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, Files and Resources) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and generalizability concerns.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95. These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.']","The limitations of the PROMISE_exp dataset mentioned in the background are:

1. **Small Size and Class Imbalance**: The dataset suffers from a ""High Dimension, Low Sample Size"" (HDLSS) nature, which refers to a high feature-to-instance ratio and inherent class imbalance. This restricts its suitability for training complex deep learning architectures and limits its effectiveness in modern research.

2. **Single Security Class**: Security is treated as a single, high-level category, which lacks the granularity needed for detailed security requirement classification.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements."", 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME.

If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements."", ""CONTEXT: **Comparative Analysis of Security Requirement Datasets**: This chunk provides a detailed comparison of the ASRD dataset with other prominent security requirement datasets, highlighting differences in size, domain, annotation methodologies, and security granularity, while emphasizing ASRD's industrial complexity and alignment with OWASP ASVS standards.\n\nCONTENT: 8 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 1: Comparative Analysis of Security Requirement Datasets\nCharacteristic PROMISE\nexp\nDOSSPRE Healthcare\nDataset\nASRD (Ours)\nTotal Require-\nments\n969 1,317 10,963 2,652\nData Source Public SRS\ndocuments\n(expanded to\n49 projects)\n105 Student\nproject docu-\nments\n6 Official Cana-\ndian and U.S.\nSRS documents\n6 Real-world\nSRS docs from\na gov’t agency\nDomain General /\nCross-domain\nGeneral / Aca-\ndemic\nElectronic\nHealthcare\nMulti-domain:\nLegal, Const.,\nEdu., etc.\nPrimary Task FR vs. NFR,\nMulti-class\nNFR\nSR vs. NSR,\nMulti-class SR\nMulti-label\nSecurity Objec-\ntives\nMulti-label Im-\nplicit Security\nClass.\nSecurity Granu-\nlarity\nSingle SE\nclass\n10 security\nclasses\n6 security objec-\ntives\n11 OWASP\nASVS classes\nLanguage English English English Turkish\nAnnotation\nMethodology\nExpert Con-\nsensus: Man-\nual extraction\nand valida-\ntion\nAuthor Com-\npilation: Cat-\negorized by\nauthors only,\nlimited rigorous\nvalidation\nMulti-Stage\nConsensus: 2\nresearchers +\nmediator, high\nagreement\nMATTER Cy-\ncle: 3 SMEs\nwith adjudica-\ntion, iterative\nrefinement and\nabjudication\nKey Strength Established\nbenchmark\nand project\ndiversity\nFine-grained\nsecurity-specific\ntaxonomy\nLarge scale and\ndomain authen-\nticity\nIndustrial\ncomplexity +\nOWASP ASVS\nKey Limitation Small size\nand class\nimbalance\nPotential lack of\nprofessional re-\nalism\nDomain-\nspecific; coarse-\ngrained labels\nReal-world class\nimbalance in\nspecific cate-\ngories\nimbalance often restrict its suitability for training complex deep learning ar-\nchitectures.\n2.3.2 DOSSPRE\nThe Dataset of Students’ Software Projects Requirements (DOSSPRE) was\ncompiled by Kadebu et al. from documentation within academic curricula\n(Kadebu et al., 2023), likely from the Harare Institute of Technology.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Security Frameworks and Related Datasets**: This section contrasts various security frameworks, highlighting the suitability of OWASP ASVS for fine-grained security requirement classification, and reviews existing security-related datasets, emphasizing their limitations and relevance to automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated.

However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE).

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual approaches, and highlights the potential of AI-driven methods and the OWASP ASVS framework to address these gaps in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk introduces the motivation and objectives of the study, emphasizing the need for automating the classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents using AI-driven methodologies, and presents the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD) as a novel resource for addressing challenges in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Noname manuscript No.\n(will be inserted by the editor)\nImplicit Security Requirements Classification\nwith Large Language Models Using the OWASP\nApplication Security Verification Standard: A\nShift-Left Approach.\nYusuf G¨ ur·Tu˘ gba Ta¸ skaya Temizel·\nBanu G¨ unel Kılı¸ c\nReceived: date / Accepted: date\nAbstractCybersecurity threats require early integration of security, starting\nfrom the requirements analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies. Fleiss’s Kappa coefficient of 0.82 was obtained\nacross the three annotators, indicating strong agreement that significantly\nexceeded random chance.

However, these results ob-\nscure the impact of class imbalance. Macro-F1 scores, which give equal weight\nto all categories, were lower, ranging from 0.942 to 0.914, revealing reduced\nperformance on less frequent classes.\nThis pattern is clear in the category-level results (Appendix C). Perfor-\nmance was high for common categories such as V8 (Data Protection), where\nthe bert-base-multilingual-uncased model achieved an F1-score of 0.992. In\ncontrast, results declined significantly for sparsely represented categories. For\nV6 (38 samples), F1-scores fell to 0.714 for bert-base-uncased and 0.734 for\nSecureBERT. The weakest performance was observed for V10 (27 samples),\nwith F1-scores around 0.60, indicating limited generalization due to limited\ndata.\nAn analysis of precision and recall for these difficult classes reveals specific\nfailure patterns. For class V10, the bert-base-uncased model has a low Recall of\n0.481.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification for Security Requirements**  \nThis chunk details the experimental protocol for evaluating fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, including dataset partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to assess the impact of pre-training strategies on classification accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of Security Requirement Classification Models**: This chunk focuses on the comparative evaluation of baseline, fine-tuned, and few-shot/zero-shot LLM models for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting statistical significance, pairwise differences, and visualization of model rankings using the Critical Difference (CD) diagram.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 29\nThe analysis (Table 8) highlights the significant pairwise contrasts and\nreveals important performance distinctions:\n–Baseline vs. Advanced Models: The Naive Baseline was consistently out-\nperformed by the advanced models.

It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later.

An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Which categories were identified as 'minority classes' or underrepresented in the dataset?,"['CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME.

This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the']","The categories identified as ""minority classes"" or underrepresented in the dataset are **V6 (Stored Cryptography)** and **V12 (Files and Resources)**. These categories were noted to have significantly lower representation compared to others, reflecting real-world imbalances in security requirements. For example, V6 requirements are often captured as holistic architectural decisions rather than numerous distinct functional requirements, while V12 requirements are less frequent, appearing only in projects with specific file processing features. This imbalance poses challenges for machine learning models, particularly in generalizing to these underrepresented classes.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

The Weighted-F1 score is heavily influenced by class support (i.e., the number of samples in each class), so a model that predicts the majority class correctly can achieve a high Weighted-F1 score even if it performs poorly on minority classes. This is evident in the Naive Baseline's performance, where it achieved a Weighted-F1 of 0.933 but had a Macro-F1 of only 0.774, reflecting its inability to handle minority classes effectively. For example, its F1 score for minority classes like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) was 0.00, indicating complete failure in those categories.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification.

This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of Models for Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk provides a detailed comparison of macro, micro, and weighted F1-scores for various LLMs, fine-tuned BERT models, and baseline approaches, highlighting their effectiveness and limitations in classifying security requirements, particularly in handling class imbalance and rare categories.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 25\nTable 7: Aggregated F1-Scores for LLM, BERT Models, and Baseline\nModel Prompting Strategy Macro-F1 Micro-F1 Weighted-F1\nLarge Language Model Results\nLlama 3 70b Zero Shot 0.813 0.941 0.941\nLlama 3 70b Few Shot 0.802 0.925 0.925\nDeepSeek R1 Zero Shot 0.812 0.921 0.916\nDeepSeek R1 Few Shot 0.820 0.927 0.921\nGemini 2.5 Zero Shot 0.8290.957 0.953\nGemini 2.5 Few Shot 0.8170.963 0.959\nGemini 2.0 Zero Shot0.8900.925 0.921\nGemini 2.0 Few Shot0.9410.938 0.938\nGemini 2.0 Pro Zero Shot 0.830 0.908 0.904\nGemini 2.0 Pro Few Shot 0.889 0.959 0.953\nGemma 3 27b Zero Shot 0.806 0.912 0.907\nGemma 3 27b Few Shot 0.802 0.917 0.912\nGemma 3 4b Zero Shot 0.605 0.738 0.742\nGemma 3 4b Few Shot 0.723 0.871 0.867\nGpt 4o Zero Shot 0.790 0.912 0.907\nGpt 4o Few Shot 0.814 0.943 0.939\nGpt 4o mini Zero Shot 0.703 0.803 0.809\nGpt 4o mini Few Shot 0.754 0.852 0.854\nBERT Fine-Tuning Results\nbert-base-multilingual-uncased Fine-Tuning0.942 0.985 0.983\nbert-base-turkish-cased Fine-Tuning 0.933 0.983 0.981\nbert-base-uncased Fine-Tuning 0.914 0.978 0.976\nSecureBERT Fine-Tuning 0.918 0.979 0.976\nBaseline\nNaive Baseline Majority Class 0.774 0.940 0.933\nrepresented categories.

Specifically, the few-shot setup included 30 training instances selected to capture multi-label cases, cover all 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and reflect linguistic variation across different business domains. 

Additionally, persona-based prompting was applied, instructing the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This approach aimed to reduce output variance and align responses with professional domain expertise. The final prompt was refined iteratively to ensure instruction clarity, contextual grounding, and constraint formatting for machine-readability. Fixed parameters (e.g., Temperature = 0, Top-p = 0.95) were used, and results were averaged across three repetitions to minimize non-deterministic fluctuations.

The strategy prioritized representativeness of examples over performance optimization, focusing on experimental control and cross-model comparability rather than maximizing scores. Static Few-Shot Prompting was used, but its limitations were noted, particularly for rare, high-variance security classes where static examples failed to generalize effectively.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Evaluation of LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk presents detailed test results of various Gemini LLM models (e.g., Gemini 2.0, Gemini 2.5) in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, evaluating their precision, recall, and F1 scores across OWASP ASVS security verification categories to assess their effectiveness in automating security requirements classification.\n\nCONTENT: Test Results of the LLMs used in the study\nGemini_2_5_Few_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.979 0.972 0.980 0.914 0.229 0.985 0.972 0.974 0.868 0.203 0.900RECALL 0.997 0.992 0.992 0.984 0.641 0.995 0.992 0.995 0.967 0.964 0.994F1 0.988 0.982 0.986 0.948 0.338 0.990 0.982 0.984 0.915 0.335 0.945SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGemini_2_0_Zero_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.967 0.940 0.972 0.894 0.819 0.960 0.962 0.955 0.812 0.937 0.897RECALL 0.967 0.939 0.972 0.882 0.280 0.960 0.962 0.954 0.783 0.479 0.884F1 0.990 0.963 0.990 0.994 0.718 0.977 0.984 0.982 0.900 0.821 0.981SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGemini_2_0_Few_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.982 0.972 0.985 0.922 0.754 0.985 0.967 0.975 0.894 0.764 0.917RECALL 0.982 0.972 0.985 0.910 0.210 0.985 0.967 0.974 0.874 0.223 0.905F1 0.997 0.990 0.992 0.990 0.667 0.995 0.987 0.995 0.973 0.964 0.994SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGemini_2_0_Pro_Zero_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.975 0.902 0.972 0.910 0.837 0.910 0.952 0.905 0.847 0.942 0.899RECALL 0.974 0.900 0.972 0.897 0.188 0.909 0.952 0.902 0.820 0.410 0.881F1 0.992 0.919 0.992 0.990 0.385 0.923 0.971 0.919 0.923 0.571 0.934SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGemini_2_0_Pro_Few_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements']","Based on the provided Context, the few-shot prompts used 30 labeled examples.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories.

Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase.

1. **Persona**: The prompt instructed the model to adopt the persona of an experienced cybersecurity specialist with extensive knowledge of OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr and secure software development practices. This persona emphasized meticulousness, detail orientation, and a focus on identifying security vulnerabilities and ensuring adherence to high security standards.

2. **Context**: The prompt provided detailed task instructions and definitions of OWASP ASVS categories (V2–V13) to anchor the model's responses. It included explicit definitions of security classes and heuristic rules (e.g., mapping CRUD operations to specific security categories) to ensure the model adhered to the specified standards.

3. **Constraint**: The prompt enforced a structured output format, requiring classifications in PSV format with mandatory inclusion of an ""Explanation"" column. It also specified rules for assigning ""1"" or ""0"" to each category and required concise justifications for each classification. Additionally, constraints were applied to stabilize the output structure for machine readability and ensure consistency across all rows.

These elements were designed to reduce contextual bias, improve classification accuracy, and ensure alignment with OWASP ASVS standards.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk introduces the motivation and objectives of the study, emphasizing the need for automating the classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents using AI-driven methodologies, and presents the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD) as a novel resource for addressing challenges in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Noname manuscript No.\n(will be inserted by the editor)\nImplicit Security Requirements Classification\nwith Large Language Models Using the OWASP\nApplication Security Verification Standard: A\nShift-Left Approach.\nYusuf G¨ ur·Tu˘ gba Ta¸ skaya Temizel·\nBanu G¨ unel Kılı¸ c\nReceived: date / Accepted: date\nAbstractCybersecurity threats require early integration of security, starting\nfrom the requirements analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).

The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE).

Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","'Contextual Anchoring' in the context of this study's prompt engineering refers to a strategy used to mitigate contextual bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). This bias occurs when a model relies on its general training data rather than the specific task definitions provided. To address this, the study injected explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP ASVS classes and heuristic ""Extra Information"" rules directly into the prompt's context window. These rules included mappings of CRUD operations to specific security categories based on guidelines. By embedding this information into the prompt, the models were directed to adhere to the specified standards, resulting in more consistent classifications of implicit security requirements.

This approach was designed to ensure experimental control and cross-model comparability, prioritizing adherence to standards over optimized performance outcomes.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793.

For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903.

Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times.

**Evaluation of Model Performance and Prompt Engineering Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models in classifying underrepresented security categories, such as Stored Cryptography (V6) and File and Resources (V12), and details the experimental setup for zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering using persona-based strategies to improve classification accuracy and adherence to OWASP ASVS standards.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies.

When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Curation for Security Requirements**: This chunk details the iterative annotation process using the MATTER cycle to create a Gold Standard corpus for classifying implicit security requirements, including annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching.

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements."", ""CONTEXT: **Dataset Curation and Sampling for ASRD**: This chunk details the filtering, randomization, and sampling processes used to curate the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), ensuring high-quality, representative Turkish-language functional requirements across six business domains, with examples provided to illustrate the dataset's scope and alignment with OWASP ASVS security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 10 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n3.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions.

- **BERT Fine-Tuning**: Requires high data preparation (approximately 2,600 examples) and a substantial setup effort of around 267 hours.
- **LLM Few-Shot**: Requires minimal data preparation (approximately 30 examples) and a much lower setup effort of less than 10 hours.

This demonstrates that the LLM Few-Shot approach offers a more resource-efficient alternative while achieving nearly identical performance (Macro-F1 of 0.941 for LLM Few-Shot vs. 0.942 for BERT fine-tuning). This efficiency makes it particularly advantageous in industrial settings where reducing annotation and setup time is critical.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of Security Requirement Classification Models**: This chunk focuses on the comparative evaluation of baseline, fine-tuned, and few-shot/zero-shot LLM models for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting statistical significance, pairwise differences, and visualization of model rankings using the Critical Difference (CD) diagram.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 29\nThe analysis (Table 8) highlights the significant pairwise contrasts and\nreveals important performance distinctions:\n–Baseline vs. Advanced Models: The Naive Baseline was consistently out-\nperformed by the advanced models.

Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC). However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE). This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the']","SecureBERT is a domain-specific language model designed for cybersecurity tasks. It is based on the RoBERTa architecture and pre-trained on a 12GB corpus of cybersecurity texts, including sources like NVD (National Vulnerability Database), CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification). SecureBERT was included in the study to test the hypothesis that domain-specific vocabulary and context improve classification accuracy for implicit security requirements. Its fine-tuning methodology and specialized training data make it particularly suited for identifying security-related requirements, which are often abstract and challenging to classify.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement.

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data annotation effort and model performance across different approaches (BERT fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot LLMs), highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,']","The ""Long Tail"" challenge described in the discussion refers to the significant performance gap between advanced models when classifying majority versus minority security classes in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE). While models achieve near-parity performance on majority classes, they struggle with underrepresented or minority classes, which often contain critical security failures. This challenge arises due to the inherent class imbalance in security requirements datasets, where categories like cryptographic storage (V6) and file handling (V12) are less frequently represented compared to user-facing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). 

Standard supervised learning and few-shot prompting methods often fail to generalize effectively for these rare classes, leading to low recall and precision. Addressing this ""long-tail"" distribution requires innovative approaches, such as dynamic few-shot selection, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and synthetic data generation, to improve model performance on these underrepresented categories.

What future work is proposed to handle rare security classes using RAG?,"['CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk provides an overview of prior research on NLP-based techniques for software requirements classification, emphasizing the evolution from traditional supervised learning methods to advanced transformer-based models like BERT and SecureBERT, and highlights the challenges in identifying implicit security requirements due to ambiguity and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models.

1. **Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG**: Future systems could dynamically retrieve explicit definitions and verification criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground the classification of rare requirements. Instead of relying on fixed examples, a retriever would select the most semantically similar valid requirements from the training set to serve as in-context examples for specific queries. This approach ensures the model is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g., “encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.

2. **Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework**: A multi-agent framework is proposed where automated classification is combined with expert oversight for ambiguous or high-risk cases. A retrieval-augmented agent dynamically selects relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. Another agent assesses classification confidence and flags unclear cases for human intervention. A supervisor agent consolidates inputs to ensure consistency with OWASP ASVS taxonomy. Over time, an optimization agent learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and reduce manual effort.

3. **Synthetic Data Injection for Supervised Models**: To address data sparsity, a Teacher-Student Data Generation loop is recommended. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) would generate diverse synthetic requirements to populate the training set, enabling smaller supervised models (e.g., BERT) to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.

These approaches aim to improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents by addressing challenges of data sparsity and class imbalance.

What is the proposed 'Teacher-Student Data Generation' loop?,"['CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Advancements in Automated Security Requirement Classification and Related Frameworks**: This chunk discusses the application of transformer-based models and LLMs for automated security requirement classification, emphasizing their emergent capabilities, challenges, and the importance of high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frameworks. It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE). This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,).

We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks.

Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented.

The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers:** This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned transformer models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting class imbalance challenges, statistical significance of performance differences, and the robustness of evaluation methods like the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Evaluation of

It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,']","Experimental LLMs, such as Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, were included in the evaluation to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that were not yet available in general release models.

While the use of experimental models posed challenges to reproducibility, their inclusion was deemed necessary to provide a forward-looking analysis of emerging LLM capabilities and their impact on Security Requirements Engineering.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference']","The specific threat to internal validity associated with the use of experimental LLM endpoints is **reproducibility**.

The weakest performance was observed for V10 (27 samples),\nwith F1-scores around 0.60, indicating limited generalization due to limited\ndata.\nAn analysis of precision and recall for these difficult classes reveals specific\nfailure patterns. For class V10, the bert-base-uncased model has a low Recall of\n0.481. This indicates that while its predictions were often correct (Precision:\n0.813), it failed to identify more than half of the actual V10 requirements,\nresulting in a high number of false negatives.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk provides details on the BERT-based models used in the study, including their architectures, training data, and rationale for selection, as well as the fine-tuning methodology employed for multi-label classification of security requirements in the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

Specifically:

1. **Performance Comparison**: Few-shot LLMs achieved competitive Macro-F1 scores (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot scored 0.941) that were nearly equal to fine-tuned BERT models (e.g., bert-base-multilingual-uncased scored 0.942). This demonstrates that LLMs can serve as resource-efficient alternatives to fine-tuned models without requiring extensive dataset curation and training.

2. **Resource Efficiency**: Fine-tuned models require significant effort in dataset preparation and training (e.g., 267 person-hours for annotating the ASRD dataset), whereas LLMs leverage few-shot or zero-shot strategies to achieve comparable results with less computational and human effort.

3. **Statistical Significance**: While fine-tuned models generally outperformed LLMs in zero-shot settings, the performance gap between fine-tuned models and few-shot LLMs was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.102), indicating that few-shot LLMs can match the domain-specific accuracy of fine-tuned models.

4. **Challenges**: Despite their scalability, LLMs and fine-tuned models both struggled with minority class performance due to class imbalance, highlighting the ""long tail"" challenge in Security Requirements Engineering.

This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Performance and Prompt Engineering Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models in classifying underrepresented security categories, such as Stored Cryptography (V6) and File and Resources (V12), and details the experimental setup for zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering using persona-based strategies to improve classification accuracy and adherence to OWASP ASVS standards.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

Unlike the traditional ""pre-train, fine-tune"" approach, this paradigm leverages prompt engineering to guide pre-trained models toward task-specific outputs without modifying the model's architecture or weights. 

In this paradigm:
1. **Pre-train**: The model is trained on a massive corpus of general-purpose data to develop a broad understanding of language.
2. **Prompt**: Carefully designed textual inputs (prompts) are used to steer the model's behavior for specific tasks. This can include:
   - **Zero-shot prompting**: Using the model directly without task-specific training, relying solely on the prompt's instructions.
   - **Few-shot prompting**: Including a small number of labeled examples in the prompt to help the model learn task patterns.
3. **Predict**: The model generates task-specific outputs based on the provided prompt.

This paradigm is particularly useful in scenarios with limited labeled data, as it avoids the need for extensive fine-tuning. It also supports various prompting strategies, such as:
- **Tuning-free prompting**: No changes to the model, suitable for zero-shot tasks but requiring complex prompt design.
- **Fixed-LLM prompt tuning**: Learning soft prompts while keeping the model fixed, effective for few-shot tasks but less interpretable.

In the provided context, this paradigm was applied to security requirement classification tasks, where zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies were used to classify security requirements with minimal or no task-specific training. The study emphasized tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches to avoid modifying the base LLM's weights.

Why is the OWASP ASVS framework preferred over STRIDE for this specific task?,"['CONTEXT: **Comparison of Security Frameworks and Related Datasets**: This section contrasts various security frameworks, highlighting the suitability of OWASP ASVS for fine-grained security requirement classification, and reviews existing security-related datasets, emphasizing their limitations and relevance to automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability.

In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

It offers fine-grained security requirement classification, which is essential for tasks like mapping functional and non-functional requirements to actionable security controls. In contrast, STRIDE operates at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on broad threat categories (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering) that are more suitable for threat modeling rather than granular requirement classification.

OWASP ASVS's organization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping to functional and non-functional security controls, making it more suitable for tasks requiring detailed and systematic security requirement analysis. Additionally, its alignment with standards like NIST 800-63B and its widespread adoption across industries further reinforce its suitability for such tasks.

What loss function was used for training the BERT-based models?,"['CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification for Security Requirements**  \nThis chunk details the experimental protocol for evaluating fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, including dataset partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to assess the impact of pre-training strategies on classification accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk provides details on the BERT-based models used in the study, including their architectures, training data, and rationale for selection, as well as the fine-tuning methodology employed for multi-label classification of security requirements in the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers:** This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned transformer models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting class imbalance challenges, statistical significance of performance differences, and the robustness of evaluation methods like the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the systematic optimization of BERT-based models using grid search and validation loss monitoring, as well as the adoption of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot security requirement classification tasks, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference']","The study handled the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training by tuning the label assignment threshold (Decision Threshold) rather than fixing it at 0.5. This adjustment aimed to better balance precision and recall across categories, addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance. Additionally, stratified sampling was applied during dataset partitioning to preserve label distributions across training, validation, and test sets, ensuring sufficient samples for minority classes. These measures helped mitigate the impact of underrepresented security classes on model performance.

What is the key limitation of static few-shot prompting observed in the study?,"['CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of Models for Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk provides a detailed comparison of macro, micro, and weighted F1-scores for various LLMs, fine-tuned BERT models, and baseline approaches, highlighting their effectiveness and limitations in classifying security requirements, particularly in handling class imbalance and rare categories.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 25\nTable 7: Aggregated F1-Scores for LLM, BERT Models, and Baseline\nModel Prompting Strategy Macro-F1 Micro-F1 Weighted-F1\nLarge Language Model Results\nLlama 3 70b Zero Shot 0.813 0.941 0.941\nLlama 3 70b Few Shot 0.802 0.925 0.925\nDeepSeek R1 Zero Shot 0.812 0.921 0.916\nDeepSeek R1 Few Shot 0.820 0.927 0.921\nGemini 2.5 Zero Shot 0.8290.957 0.953\nGemini 2.5 Few Shot 0.8170.963 0.959\nGemini 2.0 Zero Shot0.8900.925 0.921\nGemini 2.0 Few Shot0.9410.938 0.938\nGemini 2.0 Pro Zero Shot 0.830 0.908 0.904\nGemini 2.0 Pro Few Shot 0.889 0.959 0.953\nGemma 3 27b Zero Shot 0.806 0.912 0.907\nGemma 3 27b Few Shot 0.802 0.917 0.912\nGemma 3 4b Zero Shot 0.605 0.738 0.742\nGemma 3 4b Few Shot 0.723 0.871 0.867\nGpt 4o Zero Shot 0.790 0.912 0.907\nGpt 4o Few Shot 0.814 0.943 0.939\nGpt 4o mini Zero Shot 0.703 0.803 0.809\nGpt 4o mini Few Shot 0.754 0.852 0.854\nBERT Fine-Tuning Results\nbert-base-multilingual-uncased Fine-Tuning0.942 0.985 0.983\nbert-base-turkish-cased Fine-Tuning 0.933 0.983 0.981\nbert-base-uncased Fine-Tuning 0.914 0.978 0.976\nSecureBERT Fine-Tuning 0.918 0.979 0.976\nBaseline\nNaive Baseline Majority Class 0.774 0.940 0.933\nrepresented categories.

The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Performance and Prompt Engineering Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models in classifying underrepresented security categories, such as Stored Cryptography (V6) and File and Resources (V12), and details the experimental setup for zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering using persona-based strategies to improve classification accuracy and adherence to OWASP ASVS standards.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

This limitation is particularly evident for underrepresented and high-variance security classes, such as V12 (File and Resources). Static few-shot prompting fails to generalize well because fixed examples do not adequately capture the context-dependent nature of implicit requirements. For instance, a fixed example related to ""file upload"" does not help the model identify a requirement related to ""directory traversal,"" resulting in low F1-scores for rare classes. This demonstrates that static prompting is insufficient for handling rare, high-variance security categories.

In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE). This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies.

What is the 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work?,"['CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual approaches, and highlights the potential of AI-driven methods and the OWASP ASVS framework to address these gaps in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process. This approach enables the\nearly identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, which is both more effi-\n1 https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/', ""CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Experimental AI Models for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk focuses on the experimental use of advanced AI models, including Gemini 2.0 variants and GPT-4o, to assess their performance in classifying nuanced security contexts within the study's framework, alongside results from fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: 24 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 6 – continued from previous page\nModel Name Description Rationale in Study\ngemini-2.0-\nflash-thinking-\nexp-01-21\n(MoE Trans-\nformer;\nReasoning-\nOptimized)\nAn experimental API ver-\nsion of Google’s Gemini\nFlash model.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.']","The 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work is a system designed to enhance the classification of security requirements in Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, particularly in ambiguous or high-risk cases. This framework integrates human expertise with AI-driven processes to improve accuracy and efficiency. 

Key components of the framework include:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Agent**: Dynamically selects the most relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. This ensures the AI system is grounded in contextually appropriate data.

2. **Classification Confidence Agent**: Assesses the confidence and consistency of classifications, flags unclear cases, and requests clarifications from human experts when needed.

3. **Supervisor Agent**: Consolidates inputs from the retrieval and classification agents, ensuring final labels align with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the broader project context.

4. **Optimization Agent**: Learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security requirements.

This framework aims to combine automated classification with targeted expert oversight, leveraging human-in-the-loop processes to address the challenges of data sparsity and improve the reliability of security requirement classification.

What method is proposed to improve the evaluation of model generalizability in future studies?,"['CONTEXT: **Discussion on Model Evaluation and Challenges in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk focuses on the challenges of reproducibility and class imbalance in model evaluation, the use of experimental LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and classification performance, highlighting insights from fine-tuned BERT models and LLM prompting strategies.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Automated Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets, the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in addressing these issues, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches and retrieval-augmented methods, to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Gap Analysis and Annotation Challenges in Security Requirements Engineering**: This chunk discusses the performance disparity between advanced models on majority versus minority security classes, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the challenges of subjectivity and computational constraints in ensuring realistic and high-quality security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk provides references to key studies, models, and methodologies relevant to the classification and automation of security requirements in software development, highlighting advancements in domain-specific language models like SecureBERT and the application of AI techniques in requirements engineering.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 39\nAghaei E, Niu X, Shadid W, Al-Shaer E (2022) Securebert: A domain-specific\nlanguage model for cybersecurity.

This method involves training a model on requirements from five projects and testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six projects provides a clearer and more realistic assessment of how well the models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is a significant measure for real-world applicability.
