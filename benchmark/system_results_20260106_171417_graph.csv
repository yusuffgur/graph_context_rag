Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual methods, and highlights the potential of AI-based NLP approaches, supported by frameworks like OWASP ASVS, to address these gaps.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the limitations of existing security frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE, NIST SSDF, Common Criteria) for fine-grained security requirement classification and highlights the suitability of OWASP ASVS for this purpose. It also reviews related work on security requirement datasets, emphasizing the need for high-quality benchmarks like PROMISEExp to advance automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: **Sample Security Requirement Classifications and Dataset Overview:** This chunk provides examples of Turkish-language security requirements from the ASRD dataset, showcasing their OWASP ASVS category annotations and translations, highlighting the multi-label classification approach and the diversity of security requirements addressed in the study.\n\nCONTENT: 18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes\n\nImplicit Security Requirements Classification 19\nTable 4: Sample Requirement Classifications\nNo Original Requirements in Turkish Translated Requirements\nV2, Authentication\nV3, Session Mngmt.\nV4, Access Control\nV5, Validation\nV6, Cryptography\nV7, Error Handling\nV8, Data Protection\nV9, Communication\nV10, Malicious Code\nV12, File/Resources\nV13, API/Web Service\n1 Sistem, otel devir i¸ slemi ger¸ cekle¸ stirecektir.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the curation and preprocessing of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing the multi-stage pipeline used to extract, anonymize, and prepare real-world Turkish-language Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents for multi-label security annotation, while addressing gaps in prior datasets.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 9\n2.3.3 Electronic Health Domain Dataset\nThis corpus focuses on the electronic healthcare industry, a sector defined\nby stringent regulatory and high-assurance demands (Riaz et al., 2014).

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

1. **Implicit Nature of Security Requirements**: Security requirements are often embedded within functional descriptions rather than explicitly stated. For example, a simple requirement like ""The system will allow the user to print documents"" carries implicit security needs such as verifying user authorization, maintaining session validity, and recording actions for accountability. Identifying these implicit dependencies requires substantial expertise and guidance.

2. **Error-Prone and Inconsistent Process**: Manually identifying and validating implicit security requirements across thousands of requirements is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and lacks scalability. This process heavily relies on specialized expertise, which is both scarce and time-intensive.

3. **Dataset Limitations**: The scarcity and limited quality of domain-specific datasets further complicate manual identification. Existing datasets often lack granularity, realism, or sufficient annotations to support reliable identification of implicit security requirements.

4. **Subjectivity and Expertise Dependency**: The classification of security requirements often depends on domain-specific expertise and subjective interpretations, which can lead to inconsistencies and biases. This reliance on latent knowledge rather than explicit indicators makes manual identification particularly challenging.

5. **Industrial Gaps**: Despite advancements in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE), there is a documented gap in industrial adoption and understanding of Security Requirements Assurance (SRA). Practitioners often struggle to validate and verify security requirements effectively.

These challenges highlight the need for automated approaches, such as AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, to address the limitations of manual identification and improve scalability, accuracy, and consistency.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2.

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation.

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data preparation effort and model performance across fine-tuned BERT models and LLM approaches, highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world contexts.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of models across OWASP ASVS classes, highlighting challenges with rare categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, File Handling) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and threats to validity related to linguistic diversity and generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides a detailed example of a zero-shot prompt designed for classifying and analyzing project requirements based on the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr categories, showcasing how large language models (LLMs) can be guided to perform security-focused requirement classification with explanations, aligning with the broader study\'s focus on automating security requirements analysis.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 43\nAdvanced Intelligent Systems 6(7):2300798\nWen SF, Katt B (2023) A quantitative security evaluation and analysis model\nfor web applications based on owasp application security verification stan-\ndard.

For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines.

Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4. Randomization: The remaining requirements were randomized and masked\nto mitigate potential annotation bias related to the document source or the\nsequence of requirements.\nThe resulting ASRD comprises 2,652 well-formed functional requirements\nacross six distinct business areas: Construction (1,202), Legal (177), Education\n(312), Software (199), Meeting (126), and Accommodation (636). A sample of\nthese requirements is provided in Table 2. The requirements included in this\nsample were selected based on three specific criteria to ensure a representative\noverview:\n–Samples were chosen to reflect the varied terminology and phrasing styles\nused across the six different business domains.\n–We prioritized requirements that demonstrate how standard functional de-\nscriptions conceal underlying security dependencies.\n–We ensured that the sample includes representative examples for all 11\nOWASP ASVS security classes used in the study to demonstrate the full\nscope of the classification task.\nIt is important to note that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus; all experi-\nments detailed in this study, including BERT fine-tuning and LLM prompting,\nwere conducted exclusively on the original text.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides an overview of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data sources, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS categories, while also introducing the research questions and comparing the performance of fine-tuned transformer models and prompt-based approaches for classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: 4 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ncient and cost-effective compared to addressing security issues at later stages\nof development ((Khan et al., 2024).\nThis paper proposes a machine learning-based system to automatically an-\nalyze SRS documents and classify security requirements according to OWASP\nASVS. Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA.

Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data preparation effort and model performance across fine-tuned BERT models and LLM approaches, highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world contexts.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of models across OWASP ASVS classes, highlighting challenges with rare categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, File Handling) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and threats to validity related to linguistic diversity and generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

However, this does not reflect good performance across all classes, especially for underrepresented ones, where the model fails to generalize effectively. This is evident in the context, where the Naive Baseline's performance is significantly outperformed by advanced models like SecureBERT and Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot, which demonstrate genuine learning and better handling of imbalanced classes.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', ""CONTEXT: **Dataset Filtering and Composition for ASRD**: This chunk details the rigorous filtering, randomization, and composition process used to create the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), a Turkish-language corpus of 2,652 functional requirements across six business domains, annotated for security classification using the OWASP ASVS taxonomy. It also provides sample requirements to illustrate the dataset's diversity and focus on implicit security dependencies.\n\nCONTENT: 10 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n3. Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4. Randomization: The remaining requirements were randomized and masked\nto mitigate potential annotation bias related to the document source or the\nsequence of requirements.\nThe resulting ASRD comprises 2,652 well-formed functional requirements\nacross six distinct business areas: Construction (1,202), Legal (177), Education\n(312), Software (199), Meeting (126), and Accommodation (636).

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation.

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides an overview of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data sources, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS categories, while also introducing the research questions and comparing the performance of fine-tuned transformer models and prompt-based approaches for classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: 4 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ncient and cost-effective compared to addressing security issues at later stages\nof development ((Khan et al., 2024).\nThis paper proposes a machine learning-based system to automatically an-\nalyze SRS documents and classify security requirements according to OWASP\nASVS. Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Comparison of Models for Implicit Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk focuses on the statistical analysis and performance comparison of baseline, fine-tuned, and few-shot/zero-shot LLM models, highlighting significant differences in their ability to classify implicit security requirements, with SecureBERT and Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot emerging as top performers.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 29\nThe analysis (Table 8) highlights the significant pairwise contrasts and\nreveals important performance distinctions:\n–Baseline vs. Advanced Models: The Naive Baseline was consistently out-\nperformed by the advanced models.

This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

SecureBERT was included in the study to test the hypothesis that domain-specific pre-training enhances classification accuracy, particularly for challenging tasks like identifying implicit security requirements. The study demonstrated that SecureBERT outperformed general-purpose models and naive baselines, showing statistically significant improvements in performance metrics such as Weighted-F1 scores.

The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Why is the OWASP ASVS framework preferred over STRIDE for this specific task?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD, following the MATTER cycle framework. It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides detailed descriptions of OWASP ASVS categories (V2–V13) and their associated security requirements, along with guidelines for classifying requirements based on specific operations (e.g., CRUD, file handling, sensitive data) and an output format for structured classification.\n\nCONTENT: 3.0). \nV4, Erişim Kontrolleri (Access Controls) - Covers requirements related to authorization, role management, \nand preventing unauthorized access to resources (e.g., ASVS 4.0). \nV5, ""Doğrulama, Temizleme ve Şifreleme"" (Verification, Cleaning, and Encryption) - Covers requirements \nrelated to input validation, output encoding, data sanitization, and cryptographic protection of sensitive \ndata (e.g., ASVS 5.0). \nV6, Depolanmış Kriptografi (Stored Cryptography) - Covers requirements for protecting data at rest using \ncryptography, including key management and secure storage of encryption keys (e.g., ASVS 6.0). \nV7, Hata Ayıklama ve Kayıt (Debugging and Logging) - Covers requirements related to secure logging \npractices, error handling, and preventing information leakage through debug information (e.g., ASVS 7.0). \nV8, Veri Koruma (Data Protection) - Covers requirements related to data at rest and in transit protection, \nincluding encryption, backups, and data retention policies (e.g., ASVS 8.0). \nV9, İletişim (Communication) - Covers requirements related to secure communication protocols, protecting \nagainst network attacks, and ensuring data integrity during transmission (e.g., ASVS 9.0). \nV10, Zararlı Kod (Malicious Code) - Covers requirements related to preventing and mitigating the risk of \nmalicious code injection, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (e.g., ASVS 10.0). \nV12, Dosya ve Kaynakları (Files and Resources) - Covers requirements related to secure file handling, \naccess control to files and resources, and preventing directory traversal attacks (e.g., ASVS 12.0). \nV13, API ve Web Servisleri (API and Web Services) - Covers requirements specific to securing web \nservices, APIs, and microservices, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and error \nhandling (e.g., ASVS 13.0). \n \n********* \n \nExtra Information for Choosing Categories (Aligned with OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr): \n \nAccording to given descriptions for kind of requirements, we can decide categories as in PSV: \n \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Create operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Read operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Update operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Delete operation|1|1|1|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes User Types: usage of various user types as role management|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes Store: actions related to storage and backup of the assets at rest, e.g., backing up \nlog files|0|0|0|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|0| \nIf Requirement describes Transfer: actions related to transfer or sharing of the assets, e.g., sending data \nfrom one service to another|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes Upload and Download Files etc. operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|0|1|1|1|1| \nIf Requirement describes operation on sensitive data like personal, financial, health etc|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0| \n \n \n********* \nOutput (PSV- The requirements that are classified): \nWe need each requirement response in given format below within new line separator: \n<Requirement Number>|<Requirement \nDescription>|<V2>|<V3>|<V4>|<V5>|<V6>|<V7>|<V8>|<V9>|<V10>|<V12>|<V13>|<Explanation> format. \nand will contain: \n   - Requirement Number (integer) \n   - Requirement Description (string)', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of models across OWASP ASVS classes, highlighting challenges with rare categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, File Handling) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and threats to validity related to linguistic diversity and generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95. These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to']","The OWASP ASVS framework is preferred over STRIDE for this specific task because it provides a structured and detailed taxonomy (categories V2–V13) for classifying security requirements, ensuring consistency and accuracy in identifying implicit security dependencies. The OWASP ASVS framework aligns closely with the iterative annotation methodology described in the MATTER cycle, which emphasizes expert-driven classification and refinement of guidelines. This structured approach allows for precise mapping of functional requirements to actionable security controls, making it particularly effective for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.

In contrast, STRIDE is a threat modeling framework focused on identifying and categorizing threats (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege). While STRIDE is useful for threat identification, it lacks the granular categorization and direct applicability to functional requirements classification provided by OWASP ASVS. The OWASP ASVS framework's focus on actionable security controls and its alignment with ""Security by Design"" principles make it better suited for tasks like implicit security requirements classification.

What is the 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","The 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work is a system designed to enhance classification accuracy and address challenges like dataset sparsity and rare security requirements. It involves a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent setup that integrates automated processes with expert oversight for ambiguous or high-risk cases. The framework consists of multiple agents working collaboratively:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Agent**: Dynamically selects the most relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples.
2. **Assessment Agent**: Evaluates classification confidence and consistency, flags unclear cases, and requests clarifications from human experts when necessary.
3. **Supervisor Agent**: Consolidates inputs from the retrieval and assessment agents, ensuring final labels align with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the broader project context.
4. **Optimization Agent**: Learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security requirements.

This framework aims to combine the strengths of AI-driven automation with human expertise to improve the reliability and accuracy of security requirement classifications, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios.
