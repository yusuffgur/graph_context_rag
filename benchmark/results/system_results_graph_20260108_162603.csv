It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of LLMs and Fine-Tuned Models for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0) and fine-tuned transformer models for classifying implicit security requirements, emphasizing the practicality of LLMs as resource-efficient alternatives in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942. This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of LLM Capabilities and Security Frameworks in SRE**: This chunk discusses the application of transformer-based models and LLMs in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE), emphasizing their emergent abilities, challenges, and the importance of high-quality datasets and standardized frameworks for reliable security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets like ASRD, highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with in-context examples, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented methods, and agent-based strategies to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4).

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

1. **Implicit Nature of Security Requirements**: Security requirements are often not explicitly stated in functional descriptions. For example, a simple requirement like ""The system will allow the user to print documents"" implicitly involves security concerns such as user authorization, session management, and logging. Identifying these implicit dependencies requires substantial expertise and effort.

2. **Error-Prone and Inconsistent Process**: Manually identifying and validating the network of implicit security dependencies across thousands of requirements is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and lacks scalability.

3. **Scarcity of Suitable Datasets**: The development of automated methods is hindered by the lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. Existing datasets often lack granularity, realism, or sufficient annotations, making it difficult to support reliable evaluation and development of methods for uncovering implicit security requirements.

4. **High Dependency on Expertise**: The process relies heavily on specialized security expertise, which is scarce and time-intensive, further complicating manual analysis.

5. **Complexity of Security Control Areas**: Security requirements span multiple control areas such as access control, session management, logging, data protection, and more. This complexity necessitates substantial guidance and structured frameworks like OWASP ASVS to ensure comprehensive coverage.

For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework. It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Who performed the annotations for the ASRD?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework. It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations.

The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Minority Class Challenges and Expert-Driven Annotation in SRE**: This chunk discusses the performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification, the expert-driven annotation process using the MATTER cycle, and the measures taken to ensure realistic and challenging test scenarios for evaluating advanced models in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations.

The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Process and Quality Assurance**: This chunk details the iterative annotation process for the ASRD dataset, including pilot and independent annotation phases, adjudication meetings, and the use of agreement metrics like Fleiss’s Kappa to ensure high-quality and consistent annotations aligned with OWASP ASVS guidelines.\n\nCONTENT: 16 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n(1) original text and annotations were recoverable, (2) clear documenta-\ntion was maintained, (3) annotation quality was consistently high. The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies. Fleiss’s Kappa coefficient of 0.82 was obtained\nacross the three annotators, indicating strong agreement that significantly\nexceeded random chance.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.']","The study excluded three specific OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 classes: **V1 (Architecture, Design, and Threat Modeling)**, **V11 (Business Logic Security Requirements)**, and **V14 (Configuration Management)**.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **ASRD Dataset Filtering and Composition**: This chunk details the rigorous filtering, randomization, and composition process used to create the ASRD dataset, ensuring high-quality, well-formed functional requirements across six business domains.

However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE).

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', ""CONTEXT: **Comparison of Security Requirement Datasets**: This chunk provides a comparative analysis of various security requirement datasets, including the ASRD, highlighting their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and methodologies, with a focus on the ASRD's industrial complexity and alignment with the OWASP ASVS framework.\n\nCONTENT: 8 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 1: Comparative Analysis of Security Requirement Datasets\nCharacteristic PROMISE\nexp\nDOSSPRE Healthcare\nDataset\nASRD (Ours)\nTotal Require-\nments\n969 1,317 10,963 2,652\nData Source Public SRS\ndocuments\n(expanded to\n49 projects)\n105 Student\nproject docu-\nments\n6 Official Cana-\ndian and U.S.\nSRS documents\n6 Real-world\nSRS docs from\na gov’t agency\nDomain General /\nCross-domain\nGeneral / Aca-\ndemic\nElectronic\nHealthcare\nMulti-domain:\nLegal, Const.,\nEdu., etc.\nPrimary Task FR vs. NFR,\nMulti-class\nNFR\nSR vs. NSR,\nMulti-class SR\nMulti-label\nSecurity Objec-\ntives\nMulti-label Im-\nplicit Security\nClass.\nSecurity Granu-\nlarity\nSingle SE\nclass\n10 security\nclasses\n6 security objec-\ntives\n11 OWASP\nASVS classes\nLanguage English English English Turkish\nAnnotation\nMethodology\nExpert Con-\nsensus: Man-\nual extraction\nand valida-\ntion\nAuthor Com-\npilation: Cat-\negorized by\nauthors only,\nlimited rigorous\nvalidation\nMulti-Stage\nConsensus: 2\nresearchers +\nmediator, high\nagreement\nMATTER Cy-\ncle: 3 SMEs\nwith adjudica-\ntion, iterative\nrefinement and\nabjudication\nKey Strength Established\nbenchmark\nand project\ndiversity\nFine-grained\nsecurity-specific\ntaxonomy\nLarge scale and\ndomain authen-\nticity\nIndustrial\ncomplexity +\nOWASP ASVS\nKey Limitation Small size\nand class\nimbalance\nPotential lack of\nprofessional re-\nalism\nDomain-\nspecific; coarse-\ngrained labels\nReal-world class\nimbalance in\nspecific cate-\ngories\nimbalance often restrict its suitability for training complex deep learning ar-\nchitectures.\n2.3.2 DOSSPRE\nThe Dataset of Students’ Software Projects Requirements (DOSSPRE) was\ncompiled by Kadebu et al. from documentation within academic curricula\n(Kadebu et al., 2023), likely from the Harare Institute of Technology.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Acknowledgments, Ethical Declarations, and Dataset Accessibility**: This section outlines the funding sources, ethical considerations, author contributions, and the public availability of the ASRD dataset, emphasizing transparency and collaboration in the research process.\n\nCONTENT: 38 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nASRD into English.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off.

The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories.

In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site']","The fine-tuned BERT model that achieved the highest Weighted-F1 score is **bert-base-multilingual-uncased**, with a score of **0.983**.

This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the performance comparison of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superiority of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of the observed performance differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides detailed

on the performance of various LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly in underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides an overview of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data origins, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS, while introducing the research questions and comparing the performance of fine-tuned transformer models and prompt-based approaches for classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: 4 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ncient and cost-effective compared to addressing security issues at later stages\nof development ((Khan et al., 2024).\nThis paper proposes a machine learning-based system to automatically an-\nalyze SRS documents and classify security requirements according to OWASP\nASVS. Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 3 describes the curation and expert anno-\ntation of the ASRD and summarizes its key characteristics. Section 4 outlines\nthe experimental setup and classification methods, including fine-tuned BERT\nmodels and prompt-based approaches. Section 5 reports the experimental re-\nsults.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

Which categories were identified as 'minority classes' or underrepresented in the dataset?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting in LLMs for minority classes, the comparable performance of fine-tuned BERT models and top-tier LLMs like Gemini 2.0, and the implications of these advancements for implementing ""Security by Design"" and ""Shift-Left"" strategies in software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself.

For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets like ASRD, highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with in-context examples, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented methods, and agent-based strategies to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', ""CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Dataset Validity**: This section provides a comparative analysis of model performance across OWASP ASVS classes using visualizations like heatmaps and critical difference diagrams, highlights challenges with rare security classes (e.g., V6 and V12), and discusses the dataset's linguistic diversity, domain coverage, and potential limitations in generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95.

In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Evaluation of LLMs in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk presents the test results of various LLMs, including GPT-4o in few-shot and zero-shot settings, highlighting their precision, recall, and F1 scores across OWASP ASVS security verification categories, with a focus on their effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets.\n\nCONTENT: Test Results of the LLMs used in the study\nGpt_4o_Few_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.969 0.956 0.969 0.946 0.205 0.974 0.961 0.951 0.928 0.357 0.938RECALL 0.982 0.971 0.977 0.949 0.205 0.982 0.974 0.961 0.943 0.357 0.953F1 0.975 0.964 0.973 0.948 0.205 0.978 0.968 0.956 0.936 0.357 0.945SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGpt_4o_mini_Zero_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.953 0.865 0.928 0.829 0.254 0.824 0.671 0.779 0.659 0.093 0.720RECALL 0.963 0.877 0.938 0.863 0.385 0.828 0.680 0.785 0.690 0.250 0.736F1 0.958 0.871 0.933 0.846 0.306 0.826 0.675 0.782 0.674 0.136 0.728SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398\nGpt_4o_mini_Few_Shot\nV2, Authentication Verification Requirements\nV3, Session Management Verification Requirements\nV4, Access Control Verification Requirements\nV5, Validation, Sanitization and Encoding Verification Requirements\nV6, Stored Cryptography Verification Requirements\nV7, Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements\nV8, Data Protection Verification Requirements\nV9, Communications Verification Requirements\nV10, Malicious Code Verification Requirements\nV12, File and Resources Verification Requirements\nV13, API and Web Service Verification Requirements\nPRECISION 0.969 0.956 0.964 0.821 0.128 0.959 0.871 0.862 0.768 0.179 0.813RECALL 0.976 0.966 0.969 0.829 0.128 0.964 0.878 0.866 0.773 0.179 0.821F1 0.973 0.961 0.966 0.825 0.128 0.962 0.874 0.864 0.771 0.179 0.817SUPPORT 382 381 385 314 38 389 384 380 299 27 317TOTAL 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398 398', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Evaluation of LLMs in Security

high Weighted-F1 score despite poor overall classification because it exploited the class imbalance in the dataset. The dataset's imbalance allowed the baseline model, which always predicts the most frequent class, to achieve high accuracy and Weighted-F1 scores by ignoring minority classes. This approach results in a high Weighted-F1 score since the metric is influenced by the performance on the majority class, which dominates the dataset. However, the model's Macro-F1 score and performance on minority classes (e.g., V6 - Stored Cryptography and V12 - Files and Resources) were significantly lower, highlighting its inability to handle underrepresented categories effectively.

What is 'Contextual Anchoring' in the context of this study's prompt engineering?,"['CONTEXT: **Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Performance Variability**: This section examines the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly in underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Optimizing Model Configurations and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the systematic grid search for fine-tuning BERT variants and explores prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches to enhance task-specific performance without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Enhancing Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to address dataset sparsity and improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides a detailed example of a few-shot prompt designed to classify and analyze software requirements based on the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr framework, focusing on identifying implicit security requirements in project specifications using a cybersecurity specialist persona.\n\nCONTENT: - <V2> through <V13>: (either 1 (if the requirement aligns with the category) or 0 (if it doesn\'t)) \n   - Explanation (string) \n***** \nInput (PSV - The requirements you want to classify): \n1|Sistem, kullanıcının konaklama ücret tipi bilgilerini girmesini sağlayacaktır \n3|Sistem, kullanıcının konaklama ücret tipi bilgilerini silmesini sağlayacaktır \n5|Sistem, kullanıcının oda tiplerini güncellemesini sağlayacaktır \n16|Sistem, kullanıcının otele giriş nedeni bilgisini girmesini sağlayacaktır \n22|Sistem, kullanıcının çalışma tip bilgisini girmesini sağlayacaktır \n28|Sistem, kullanıcının otel rezervasyon para yatırma süre bilgisini girmesini sağlayacaktır \n31|Sistem, kullanıcının misafir türü kaydetmesini sağlayacaktır. \n37|Sistem, kullanıcının oda tiplerini listelemesini sağlayacaktır. \n41|Sistem, kullanıcının otele giriş neden bilgilerini listelemesini sağlayacaktır. \n44|Sistem, kullanıcının arananlar bilgisini listelemesini sağlayacaktır. \n52|Sistem, kullanıcının yakınlık tanım bilgisini seçilen kriterlere göre sorgulayabilmesini sağlayacaktır. \n54|Sistem, kullanıcının arananlar bilgisini seçilen kriterlere göre sorgulayabilmesini sağlayacaktır. \n55|Sistem, kullanıcının otel rezervasyon iptal süre bilgisini seçilen kriterlere göre sorgulayabilmesini \nsağlayacaktır. \n65|Sistem, kullanıcının otelin katlarındaki oda doluluk oranlarını seçilen kriterlere göre sorgulayabilmesini \nsağlayacaktır. \n70|Sistem, kullanıcının otel raporlarında kullanıcı imza bilgisi girmesini sağlayacaktır.\n\nFEW SHOTS PROMPT \nPersona: You are an experienced cybersecurity specialist with extensive knowledge of the OWASP ASVS \n4.0.3-tr and secure software development practices.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of LLMs and Fine-Tuned Models for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0) and fine-tuned transformer models for classifying implicit security requirements, emphasizing the practicality of LLMs as resource-efficient alternatives in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,']","'Contextual Anchoring' in the context of this study's prompt engineering refers to a strategy used to mitigate contextual bias in large language models (LLMs). This bias occurs when a model relies on its general training data rather than the specific task definitions provided. To address this, the study employed Contextual Anchoring by injecting explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP ASVS classes and heuristic ""Extra Information"" rules (e.g., mapping CRUD operations to specific security categories) directly into the prompt's context window. This approach ensured that the models adhered to the specified standards, resulting in more consistent classifications of implicit security requirements.

A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context."", 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories.

For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides an overview of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data origins, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS, while introducing the research questions and comparing the performance of fine-tuned transformer models and prompt-based approaches for classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: 4 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ncient and cost-effective compared to addressing security issues at later stages\nof development ((Khan et al., 2024).\nThis paper proposes a machine learning-based system to automatically an-\nalyze SRS documents and classify security requirements according to OWASP\nASVS.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides examples of security requirements translated from Turkish to English, demonstrating the practical application of the ASRD dataset, and discusses the adoption of the OWASP ASVS framework as a standardized taxonomy for security verification, highlighting its alignment with international regulatory standards like NIST 800-63b.\n\nCONTENT: 12 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 2 – continued from previous page\nNu Original Requirements Translated Requirements\n21 Sistem, tarayıcı ¨ uzerinde g¨ osterilen fil-\nigranı, kullanıcı adı ve IP bilgisi gibi\nalanları ¸ sifrelemesi ile olu¸ sturacaktır.\nThe system shall generate\nbrowser-displayed watermarks by\nencrypting information such as\nusername and IP address.\n22 Sistem, y¨ oneticinin, g¨ orevli personel\ni¸ cin kullanıcı hesabı olu¸ sturabilmesini\nsa˘ glayacaktır.\nThe system shall allow the administra-\ntor to create user accounts for assigned\npersonnel.\n23 Sistem, y¨ oneticinin, kullanıcının aktif\ndizinde ¨ uye olabilece˘ gi g¨ uvenlik gru-\nplarını se¸ cebilmesini sa˘ glayacaktır.\nThe system shall allow the administra-\ntor to select security groups for users in\nthe Active Directory.\n24 Sistem, g¨ u¸ cl¨ u ¸ sifrelerin kullanılmasını\nzorunlu kılacaktır.\nThe system shall enforce the use of\nstrong passwords.\n25 Sistem, kullanıcıların ¸ sifrelerini\ny¨ onetebilmesine olanak sa˘ glayacaktır.\nThe system shall allow users to manage\ntheir passwords.\n26 Sistem, kullanıcının 10 dk boyunca\ni¸ slem yapmaması durumunda oturu-\nmunu sonlandıracaktır.\nThe system shall terminate a user ses-\nsion if no transaction is performed\nwithin 10 minutes.\n27 Sistem, kullanıcıların ilk oturum\ng¨ uvenlik ayarlarının uygulanmasını\nzorunlu kılacaktır.\nThe system shall enforce the configu-\nration of security settings during the\nuser’s first login.\n28 Sistem, y¨ oneticilerin alan ve yetki\nprensibine g¨ ore i¸ slem yapabilmesini\nsa˘ glayacaktır.\nThe system shall allow administrators\nto act according to domain and autho-\nrization principles.\n29 Sistem, kullanıcıların kayıtlarını tuta-\ncaktır.\nThe system shall maintain logs of user\nactivities.\n30 Sistem, kullanıcıların etkile¸ simleri\ng¨ uvenlik do˘ grulaması yapılacaktır.\nThe system shall perform authentica-\ntion for all users accessing the system.\n3.2 Framework and OWASP Classes Selection\nIncreasing web application complexity and threat sophistication necessitate\nstandardized, requirement-level security verification.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025).

In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context."", 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets like ASRD, highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with in-context examples, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented methods, and agent-based strategies to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference']","The estimated setup effort for the LLM Few-Shot approach is significantly lower compared to BERT fine-tuning. According to the provided context, BERT fine-tuning requires high data preparation (approximately 2,600 examples) and substantial setup effort (267 hours). In contrast, the LLM Few-Shot approach requires only a small number of in-context examples (approximately 30 examples per prompt) and minimal setup effort (less than 10 hours). Despite the reduced effort, the LLM Few-Shot approach achieves comparable performance (Macro-F1 score of 0.941) to BERT fine-tuning (Macro-F1 score of 0.942), making it a more resource-efficient option for industrial settings.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the performance comparison of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superiority of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of the observed performance differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.']","SecureBERT is a domain-specific language model for cybersecurity, based on RoBERTa, and fine-tuned to classify implicit security requirements in software requirements specification (SRS) documents. It was pretrained on cybersecurity datasets such as NVD, CVE, and CAPEC, making it particularly effective in identifying security-related requirements across various OWASP ASVS verification categories, including Authentication, Access Control, Data Protection, and more. SecureBERT is part of the broader category of fine-tuned transformer-based models and is managed on Hugging Face.

It was included in the study because it demonstrated strong performance in classifying implicit security requirements, particularly in handling rare classes like Stored Cryptography (V6) and Files and Resources (V12). The study highlighted that SecureBERT outperformed general-purpose large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o in zero-shot and few-shot settings and achieved statistically significant results compared to baseline models. Its inclusion allowed the researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning in comparison to general-purpose LLMs for security requirements classification.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017).

These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942).

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Acknowledgments, Ethical Declarations, and Dataset Accessibility**: This section outlines the funding sources, ethical considerations, author contributions, and the public availability of the ASRD dataset, emphasizing transparency and collaboration in the research process.\n\nCONTENT: 38 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nASRD into English.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Exploration of LLM Capabilities and Security Frameworks in SRE**: This chunk discusses the application of transformer-based models and LLMs in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE), emphasizing their emergent abilities, challenges, and the importance of high-quality datasets and standardized frameworks for reliable security requirement classification.\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of LLMs and Fine-Tuned Models for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0) and fine-tuned transformer models for classifying implicit security requirements, emphasizing the practicality of LLMs as resource-efficient alternatives in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,']","The ""Long Tail"" challenge described in the discussion refers to the persistent issue of class imbalance in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE). Specifically, it highlights the difficulty in achieving high performance on underrepresented or minority security classes, which are often critical but occur far less frequently in datasets. This creates a ""long-tail"" distribution where the most important security failures often reside in the least represented classes. 

Standard supervised learning methods and even few-shot prompting struggle to generalize effectively from such limited examples. For instance, while advanced models like LLMs and fine-tuned transformers achieve near-parity performance on majority classes, a significant performance gap remains for minority classes. Addressing this challenge requires strategies such as targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods, and hybrid approaches combining LLMs with external knowledge bases.

What future work is proposed to handle rare security classes using RAG?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Enhancing Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to address dataset sparsity and improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets like ASRD, highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with in-context examples, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented methods, and agent-based strategies to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery.

Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data.

(Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later.

In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 7 examines', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.']","The proposed future work to handle rare security classes using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) includes the following key advancements:

1. **Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG**:  
   - Future systems could dynamically retrieve explicit definitions and verification criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground the classification of rare security requirements.  
   - Instead of relying on fixed examples, a retriever would select the most semantically similar valid requirements from the training set to serve as in-context examples for a specific query.  
   - This approach ensures that the model is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g., ""encryption"" vs. ""hashing"") rather than generic class examples.

2. **Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework**:  
   - A multi-agent framework is proposed where a retrieval-augmented agent dynamically selects relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity.  
   - A second agent assesses classification confidence and flags unclear cases for human expert intervention.  
   - A supervisor agent consolidates inputs to ensure consistency with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy, while an optimization agent learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and reduce manual effort over time.

3. **Synthetic Data Injection**:  
   - To address dataset sparsity, a Teacher-Student Data Generation loop is proposed. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) would generate diverse synthetic requirements to populate the training set.  
   - This would allow smaller supervised models (e.g., BERT) to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring extensive manual annotation.

These advancements aim to improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification, particularly for underrepresented or rare security classes, by leveraging RAG, human-AI collaboration, and synthetic data generation.

What is the proposed 'Teacher-Student Data Generation' loop?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Enhancing Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to address dataset sparsity and improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Experimental LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models for Security Classification**  \nThis chunk focuses on the evaluation of experimental Gemini and GPT-4o models, alongside fine-tuned BERT variants, analyzing their performance in classifying security requirements, with an emphasis on reasoning capabilities, cost-efficiency, and architectural advancements.\n\nCONTENT: 24 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 6 – continued from previous page\nModel Name Description Rationale in Study\ngemini-2.0-\nflash-thinking-\nexp-01-21\n(MoE Trans-\nformer;\nReasoning-\nOptimized)\nAn experimental API ver-\nsion of Google’s Gemini\nFlash model.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

It involves using high-reasoning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro as ""teachers"" to generate diverse synthetic security requirements. These synthetic samples are crafted to implicitly trigger classifications for rare security categories, such as V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources). The generated data is then used to train smaller, supervised models like BERT, which act as ""students."" This approach allows the smaller models to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation. 

The loop aims to improve the performance of supervised models in handling rare and underrepresented security classes, enhancing their generalizability and scalability in real-world applications.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Specifically, these models were tested to evaluate the impact of built-in reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought processes) on classification accuracy and to benchmark their performance against fine-tuned BERT models and other industry-standard LLMs. 

The inclusion of experimental models allowed researchers to analyze frontier-level capabilities, such as few-shot and zero-shot prompting strategies, and to determine whether these models could match or exceed the performance of fine-tuned models in practical applications like Security Requirements Engineering (SRE). For example, Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.941, comparable to the best fine-tuned BERT model's score of 0.942, demonstrating that few-shot prompting with advanced LLMs can be a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning.

Additionally, experimental models were accessed prior to general availability to evaluate their architectural updates and reasoning optimizations, which could improve detection of nuanced security contexts, such as Stored Cryptography and File Resources Verification Requirements. This approach provided insights into the strengths and limitations of cutting-edge LLMs in handling complex, multimodal reasoning tasks.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in security requirements classification, particularly when using fine-tuned BERT models and experimental LLMs, while highlighting the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.

Specifically, Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.941, which is nearly equal to the best fine-tuned BERT model's score of 0.942. This demonstrates that LLMs represent a practical and resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuned models, particularly in domains like Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).

However, fine-tuned models retain advantages in handling minority classes and achieving slightly higher overall performance. The trade-off lies in the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, which requires extensive dataset curation and computational effort, compared to the more scalable and efficient few-shot prompting approach of LLMs.

This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Enhancing Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to address dataset sparsity and improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Performance Variability**: This section examines the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly in underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148.

Unlike the traditional ""pre-train, fine-tune"" paradigm, this method leverages prompt engineering to guide pre-trained models toward desired outputs without modifying their weights or architecture. 

### Key Features:
1. **Pre-train**: The model is trained on a massive corpus of general-purpose data to develop a broad understanding of language and knowledge.
2. **Prompt**: Carefully designed textual inputs (prompts) are used to steer the model toward task-specific outputs. This step replaces the need for fine-tuning the model for each task.
3. **Predict**: The model generates predictions or outputs based on the given prompt.

### Prompting Strategies:
- **Zero-shot Prompting**: The model is used directly without any task-specific training, relying solely on the prompt to guide its behavior.
- **Few-shot Prompting**: A small number of labeled examples are included in the prompt to help the model learn the task pattern, which is particularly useful when labeled data is limited.

### Advantages:
- **Tuning-Free**: Strategies like zero-shot and fixed-LLM prompt tuning do not require changes to the model's weights, making them computationally efficient.
- **Flexibility**: Prompts can be adapted for various tasks without retraining the model.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Few-shot prompting allows for effective task performance with minimal labeled data.

### Example Applications:
- Security requirements classification using OWASP ASVS categories.
- Persona-based prompting for domain-specific tasks, such as acting as a cybersecurity specialist.

This paradigm is particularly valuable in scenarios where computational resources are limited or when rapid adaptation to new tasks is required.

Why is the OWASP ASVS framework preferred over STRIDE for this specific task?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework. It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides a detailed example of a zero-shot prompt designed for classifying and analyzing project requirements based on the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr framework, highlighting the use of persona-based prompt engineering to align security requirements with specific ASVS categories.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 43\nAdvanced Intelligent Systems 6(7):2300798\nWen SF, Katt B (2023) A quantitative security evaluation and analysis model\nfor web applications based on owasp application security verification stan-\ndard.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews re-\nlated work on NLP-based requirements classification, security frameworks, and\nexisting security datasets. Section 3 describes the curation and expert anno-\ntation of the ASRD and summarizes its key characteristics. Section 4 outlines\nthe experimental setup and classification methods, including fine-tuned BERT\nmodels and prompt-based approaches. Section 5 reports the experimental re-\nsults.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Overview of ASVS 4.0.3 Adoption and Security Classes**: This chunk discusses the widespread adoption of OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 as an industry-standard framework for application security verification across various sectors, outlines its relevance during the study period, and provides an overview of its security classes, focusing on the 11 classes used in the research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 13\n(TRM) Guidelines. In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments.

It provides a structured, industry-standard framework for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities, making it highly suitable for tasks like implicit security requirements classification. 

In contrast, STRIDE is primarily a threat modeling framework focused on identifying potential threats (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) in cyber-physical systems. It is not designed for implicit security requirements classification or aligning requirements with specific security standards like OWASP ASVS. This distinction is supported by the graph relationship indicating that STRIDE is ""NOT_DESIGNED_FOR Implicit Security Requirements Classification,"" whereas OWASP ASVS supports such tasks through its alignment with annotation guidelines and multi-label classification structure.

What loss function was used for training the BERT-based models?,"['CONTEXT: **Optimizing Model Configurations and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the systematic grid search for fine-tuning BERT variants and explores prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches to enhance task-specific performance without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: This chunk presents the performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Support) for various OWASP ASVS security verification categories, highlighting the results of BERT models in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset.

classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Performance Variability**: This section examines the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly in underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

What strategy was used to mitigate overfitting during BERT training?,"['CONTEXT: **Optimizing Model Configurations and Prompting Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the systematic grid search for fine-tuning BERT variants and explores prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, emphasizing tuning-free and fixed-LLM prompt tuning approaches to enhance task-specific performance without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Performance Variability**: This section examines the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly in underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

How did the study handle the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training?,"['CONTEXT: **Evaluation Methodology for Security Requirements Classification**: This section outlines the experimental protocol for assessing the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, detailing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics, and the transfer learning approach used for model fine-tuning.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of BERT-Based Models for Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk details the architecture, training data, and rationale behind the selection of various BERT-based models, including SecureBERT and multilingual variants, for classifying implicit security requirements, along with the fine-tuning methodology and optimization strategies used to address class imbalance and improve model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

The\nfine-tuning process was performed from end-to-end; all weights were unfrozen\nand updated to adapt the models to the specific nuances of the security re-\nquirements text.\nThe models were trained using the PyTorch Lightning framework to ensure\nreproducibility. We employed the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter,\n2019), an extension of the Adam optimizer with improved weight decay, uti-\nlizing a linear learning rate schedule with a warmup phase covering the first\n20% of training steps. This strategy stabilizes training in the initial epochs and\nimproves convergence. Given the multi-label nature of the task, Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) Loss was used as the primary objective function. Because the\nsecurity classes are unevenly distributed, the label assignment threshold (Deci-\nsion Threshold) was tuned rather than fixed at 0.5 to better balance precision\nand recall across categories.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the performance comparison of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superiority of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of the observed performance differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk provides a background on prior work in NLP-based techniques for software requirements classification, emphasizing the evolution from traditional supervised learning methods to advanced transformer-based models like BERT and SecureBERT, while highlighting challenges in identifying implicit security requirements due to dataset limitations and the subjective nature of security requirement elicitation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks. It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Metrics of Transformer

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews re-\nlated work on NLP-based requirements classification, security frameworks, and\nexisting security datasets. Section 3 describes the curation and expert anno-\ntation of the ASRD and summarizes its key characteristics. Section 4 outlines\nthe experimental setup and classification methods, including fine-tuned BERT\nmodels and prompt-based approaches. Section 5 reports the experimental re-\nsults.

Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95. These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.""]","The study handled the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training by employing several strategies:

1. **Stratified Sampling**: The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets using stratified sampling based on security class labels. This ensured that the label distributions were preserved across all splits, allowing the test set to include sufficient samples of minority classes (e.g., V6 and V12) while maintaining a large enough training set for effective fine-tuning.

2. **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss**: Given the multi-label nature of the task, BCE Loss was used as the primary objective function, which is well-suited for handling imbalanced datasets.

3. **Tuning the Decision Threshold**: Instead of fixing the label assignment threshold at 0.5, the threshold was tuned to better balance precision and recall across categories, addressing the class imbalance.

4. **Fine-Tuning with Domain-Specific Models**: Models like SecureBERT, pre-trained on cybersecurity-specific corpora, were used to improve performance on rare classes by leveraging domain-specific vocabulary and context.

5. **Performance Metrics**: The study used macro-averaged F1 scores to evaluate performance, which treats all classes equally regardless of their frequency, highlighting the impact of class imbalance on less frequent categories.

These strategies collectively helped mitigate the challenges posed by the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training.

What is the key limitation of static few-shot prompting observed in the study?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Engineering (SRE), emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual methods, and highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches and the OWASP ASVS framework for addressing these gaps.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

What role did the 'senior SME' play in the annotation process?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework. It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, emphasizing the resolution of annotator disagreements, the handling of class imbalances (notably in V6 and V12 categories), and the inclusion of ""UNASSIGNED"" requirements to ensure a realistic and high-quality dataset for evaluating security-aware NLP models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Process and Quality Assurance**: This chunk details the iterative annotation process for the ASRD dataset, including pilot and independent annotation phases, adjudication meetings, and the use of agreement metrics like Fleiss’s Kappa to ensure high-quality and consistent annotations aligned with OWASP ASVS guidelines.\n\nCONTENT: 16 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n(1) original text and annotations were recoverable, (2) clear documenta-\ntion was maintained, (3) annotation quality was consistently high. The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies. Fleiss’s Kappa coefficient of 0.82 was obtained\nacross the three annotators, indicating strong agreement that significantly\nexceeded random chance.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in security requirements classification, particularly when using fine-tuned BERT models and experimental LLMs, while highlighting the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: **Addressing Class Imbalance and Future Directions in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements datasets like ASRD, highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with in-context examples, and outlines future research directions, including hybrid approaches combining LLMs, retrieval-augmented methods, and agent-based strategies to improve performance on underrepresented security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Overview of ASVS 4.0.3 Adoption and Security Classes**: This chunk discusses the widespread adoption of OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 as an industry-standard framework for application security verification across various sectors, outlines its relevance during the study period, and provides an overview of its security classes, focusing on the 11 classes used in the research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 13\n(TRM) Guidelines. In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments. Each requirement can be mapped to more than one classes.\nTable 3: OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 Classes\nClass Id Class Name Definition\nV1 Architecture, Design and\nThreat Modeling\nThis class focuses on the security of the\napplication’s architecture, component\ndesign, and the process of identifying\nand mitigating threats throughout the\ndevelopment lifecycle.\nV2 Authentication This class deals with verifying the\nidentity of users, services, or applica-\ntions, ensuring that only authorized\nentities can access specific functionali-\nties or data.\nV3 Session Management This class covers the secure manage-\nment of user sessions, from creation\nto termination, including protection of\nsession identifiers and prevention of\nsession-related attacks.\nV4 Access Control This class ensures that users can only\naccess the data and functions for which\nthey are explicitly authorized, enforc-\ning the principle of least privilege.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for prompt engineering strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, to improve classification performance using a unified Persona–Context–Constraint approach.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides an overview of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data origins, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS, while introducing the research questions and comparing the performance of fine-tuned transformer models and prompt-based approaches for classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: 4 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ncient and cost-effective compared to addressing security issues at later stages\nof development ((Khan et al., 2024).\nThis paper proposes a machine learning-based system to automatically an-\nalyze SRS documents and classify security requirements according to OWASP\nASVS.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Specifically:

1. **Authentication (V2)**: This category ensures that only authorized users or entities can initiate or participate in the asset handover process. For example, verifying the identity of the user generating or accessing the ""Fixed Asset Handover Schedule Report"" is critical to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Access Control (V4)**: This category enforces role-based permissions and ensures that users can only access or perform actions they are explicitly authorized for. In the context of asset handover, this includes ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles or permissions can execute the handover process or access related reports.

The classification reflects the need for both identity verification and role-based access management to secure the legally binding transfer of custody, as highlighted in the study. This dual categorization aligns with the OWASP ASVS framework, which emphasizes these controls for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure operations.

What is the 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Enhancing Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to address dataset sparsity and improve the accuracy and scalability of security requirements classification in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD dataset, following the MATTER cycle framework. It describes annotator selection, corpus preparation, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the curation and preprocessing of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing the multi-stage methodology used to extract, anonymize, and prepare security requirements from real-world Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, while addressing gaps in prior datasets through industrial complexity and linguistic diversity.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 9\n2.3.3 Electronic Health Domain Dataset\nThis corpus focuses on the electronic healthcare industry, a sector defined\nby stringent regulatory and high-assurance demands (Riaz et al., 2014). The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the limitations of existing security frameworks and datasets for fine-grained security requirement classification, highlighting the suitability of OWASP ASVS for this purpose and summarizing related work on benchmark datasets like PROMISEExp.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability. In response to this need, the research community has developed\na limited number of foundational datasets for security requirements analysis,\neach offering distinct advantages and limitations.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews re-\nlated work on NLP-based requirements classification, security frameworks, and\nexisting security datasets. Section 3 describes the curation and expert anno-\ntation of the ASRD and summarizes its key characteristics. Section 4 outlines\nthe experimental setup and classification methods, including fine-tuned BERT\nmodels and prompt-based approaches. Section 5 reports the experimental re-\nsults.

This framework integrates human expertise with AI-driven automation to improve accuracy and scalability. 

Key aspects of the framework include:
1. **Human-in-the-Loop Design**: It combines automated classification with expert oversight for ambiguous or high-risk cases. This ensures that unclear classifications are reviewed and clarified by human experts.
2. **Dynamic Retrieval and Semantic Similarity**: A retrieval-augmented agent dynamically selects the most relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. This helps ground the classification process in contextually relevant data.
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
   - A second agent evaluates classification confidence and flags unclear cases for human intervention.
   - A supervisor agent consolidates inputs to ensure consistency with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and project context.
   - An optimization agent learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy.
4. **Alignment with OWASP ASVS**: The framework ensures that the final classifications are consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy, which is a detailed and developer-oriented standard for security requirements.

This framework is designed to address challenges like dataset sparsity, improve classification accuracy, and reduce manual effort over time by leveraging both human expertise and AI capabilities.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.']","The proposed method to improve the evaluation of model generalizability in future studies emphasizes the need for **realistic, high-quality datasets** and **standardized evaluation frameworks**.
