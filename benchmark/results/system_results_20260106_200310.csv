Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual approaches, and highlights the potential of AI-driven methods and the OWASP ASVS framework to address these gaps in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability.

Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement.

To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements."", ""CONTEXT: This chunk provides a list of references and related works cited in the document, highlighting foundational studies, tools, and advancements in security requirements engineering, generative AI, and the application of OWASP ASVS standards, which underpin the research's methodology and findings.\n\nCONTENT: 42 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ngpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-effective-intelligence/\nPustejovsky J, Stubbs A (2012) Natural Language Annotation for Machine\nLearning: A guide to corpus-building for applications. ” O’Reilly Media,\nInc.”\nRajbhoj A, Somase A, Kulkarni P, Kulkarni V (2024) Accelerating software\ndevelopment using generative ai: Chatgpt case study.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Header**: This chunk discusses the comparative performance of fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying implicit security requirements, emphasizing the practicality of LLMs as resource-efficient alternatives.

This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Methodology and Dataset Composition**: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, class distribution challenges due to real-world imbalances, and the inclusion of non-security requirements as true negatives to enhance model evaluation realism.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Overview of ASRD Dataset and Research Questions**: This chunk introduces the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing its real-world data, expert annotation process, and multi-label structure based on OWASP ASVS categories.

1. **Implicit Nature of Security Requirements**: Security requirements are often embedded implicitly within functional requirements rather than being explicitly stated. For example, a simple functional requirement like ""The system will allow the user to print documents"" may carry implicit security needs such as verifying user authorization, maintaining session validity, and recording actions for accountability. Identifying these implicit dependencies requires substantial expertise and effort.

2. **Error-Prone and Inconsistent Process**: Manually identifying and validating the network of implicit security dependencies across thousands of requirements is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and lacks scalability. This makes the process unreliable, especially in large-scale projects.

3. **Dependence on Specialized Expertise**: The task heavily relies on domain-specific expertise, which is scarce and costly. Security requirements elicitation involves creating templates, determining classification levels, and mapping requirements to security categories, all of which require significant manual effort.

4. **Dataset Limitations**: The lack of high-quality, domain-specific annotated datasets further complicates the process. Existing datasets are often narrow in scope, lack industrial realism, or provide only coarse-grained labels, making them insufficient for developing and evaluating methods to uncover implicit security requirements.

5. **Ambiguity in Security Requirements**: The subjective and abstract nature of security requirements, such as addressing confidentiality, integrity, and availability, adds to the difficulty of their manual identification and classification.

These challenges highlight the need for automated, AI-driven approaches to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of security requirements identification.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024).

Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.']","The specific name of the dataset introduced in this paper is the **Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD)**.

Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope.

A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies. Fleiss’s Kappa coefficient of 0.82 was obtained\nacross the three annotators, indicating strong agreement that significantly\nexceeded random chance.

Who performed the annotations for the ASRD?,"['CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data annotation effort and model performance across different approaches (BERT fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot LLMs), highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world scenarios.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility.

For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices.

Which specific OWASP ASVS classes were excluded from the study and why?,"['CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk discusses the challenges and limitations of classifying implicit security requirements, particularly for minority OWASP ASVS categories, using LLMs and fine-tuned models. It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of LLM Prompt Engineering and Model Comparisons**: This section evaluates the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of various LLMs for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting category-specific results, challenges with underrepresented classes, and a comparative analysis with fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1']","The study excluded OWASP ASVS classes V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) from achieving high performance due to their underrepresentation and severe class imbalance in the dataset. These categories were identified as ""minority classes"" with sparse and high-variance requirements, making them particularly challenging for models to classify accurately. The models struggled with these classes, showing low F1-scores and high false negatives, even with few-shot prompting strategies. The exclusion or poor performance of these classes highlights the limitations of static prompting and the difficulty of generalizing concepts for rare security categories.

It also reviews the role of security frameworks in ensuring systematic and reliable analysis in Security Requirements Engineering (SRE).\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.']","The preprocessing steps applied to the raw SRS documents included the following:

1. **Sentence Segmentation and Extraction**: A rule-based extraction method was employed to identify and extract requirement blocks. This was done using pattern matching based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each identified requirement was treated as a single processing unit, ensuring the structural integrity of the original specification was preserved.

2. **Anonymization**: A semi-automated anonymization process was implemented to protect sensitive data.

However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE).

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Acknowledgments and Ethical Considerations**: This chunk outlines the funding, ethical declarations, and contributions of the authors and subject matter experts involved in the study, emphasizing the voluntary and professional nature of their participation in the annotation process and the public availability of the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: 38 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nASRD into English.

The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While']","The six business domains covered in the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD) are:

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Weighted-F1 scores are calculated by weighting the F1 score of each class by its support (i.e., the number of true instances for each class). Since the majority class dominates the dataset, the Naive Baseline performs well on this class, leading to a high Weighted-F1 score. However, this approach fails to generalize to minority or underrepresented classes, resulting in poor overall classification performance.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

This bias occurs when a model relies on its general training data rather than the specific task definitions provided. To address this, the study incorporated explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP ASVS classes and a set of heuristic ""Extra Information"" rules (e.g., mapping CRUD operations to specific security categories based on guidelines) directly into the prompt's context window. By including this information, the models were guided to adhere to the specified standards, resulting in more consistent classifications.

This approach was designed to ensure experimental control and cross-model comparability, prioritizing conservative estimates of prompt-based performance rather than optimized results.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis of Security Requirement Classification Models**: This chunk focuses on the comparative evaluation of baseline, fine-tuned, and few-shot/zero-shot LLM models for implicit security requirements classification, highlighting statistical significance, pairwise differences, and visualization of model rankings using the Critical Difference (CD) diagram.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 29\nThe analysis (Table 8) highlights the significant pairwise contrasts and\nreveals important performance distinctions:\n–Baseline vs. Advanced Models: The Naive Baseline was consistently out-\nperformed by the advanced models. The difference between the Baseline\nand models such as SecureBERT (p <0.001) and Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot\n(p <0.001) was statistically significant, confirming that the high Weighted-\nF1 scores of these models reflect genuine learning beyond simple majority-\nclass prediction.\n–Fine-Tuning vs. Zero-Shot LLMs: Fine-tuned models like SecureBERT\ndemonstrated statistically significant performance distinctions (p <0.001)\nwhen compared to general-purpose LLMs operating in a zero-shot setting,\nsuch as GPT-4o (p <0.001) and Llama 3 70B (p <0.001). This indi-\ncates that without in-context examples, domain-specific fine-tuning retains\na measurable statistical advantage.\n–Fine-Tuning vs. Few-Shot State-of-the-Art: The pairwise comparison be-\ntween the best fine-tuned model (SecureBERT) and the best LLM ap-\nproach (Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot) yielded ap-value of 0.102. This value is not\nstatistically significant at theα= 0.05 level, supporting our finding that\nfew-shot prompting with state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively match the\nperformance of specialized, fine-tuned BERT models in this domain.\nTable 8: Significant Pairwise Differences (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test)\nModel A Model B Statistic p-value\nNaive Baseline SecureBERT 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline BERT Turkish 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline Gemini 2.0 (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline Gemini 2.0 Pro (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o Mini (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o Mini (Zero-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o (Zero-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT Gemini 2.0 (Zero-Shot) 25.0 0.501\nSecureBERT Gemini 2.0 (Few-Shot) 14.5 0.102\nTo visualize the relative performance and statistical significance groups\nof all evaluated models, we constructed a Critical Difference (CD) diagram\n(Figure 2) using the Nemenyi post-hoc test.\nIn the CD diagram, models are arranged along the horizontal axis accord-\ning to their average rank.

Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC). However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE). This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification for Security Requirements**  \nThis chunk details the experimental protocol for evaluating fine-tuned BERT-based models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, including dataset partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to assess the impact of pre-training strategies on classification accuracy.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

SecureBERT was included in the study to test the hypothesis that domain-specific vocabulary and context improve classification accuracy for security requirements. Its fine-tuning methodology and focus on cybersecurity-specific semantics make it particularly effective in identifying implicit security requirements, which are often abstract and difficult to specify precisely in practice.

The study highlighted SecureBERT's performance advantages over general-purpose models, especially in fine-tuned settings, where it demonstrated statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy. It was also used to address challenges in identifying implicit security requirements due to ambiguity and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","The proposed 'Teacher-Student Data Generation' loop is a method to address data sparsity in supervised models, particularly for security requirements classification.

These synthetic samples are designed to implicitly trigger specific classifications (e.g., V6/V12). The generated data is then used to train smaller supervised models, such as BERT, enabling them to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.

Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining.

It highlights the effectiveness of few-shot prompting with LLMs like Gemini 2.0, the resource efficiency of in-context learning, and the implications for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII).

In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', 'CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Performance and Prompt Engineering Strategies for Security Requirement Classification**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models in classifying underrepresented security categories, such as Stored Cryptography (V6) and File and Resources (V12), and details the experimental setup for zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering using persona-based strategies to improve classification accuracy and adherence to OWASP ASVS standards.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', ""CONTEXT: **Dataset Curation and Sampling for ASRD**: This chunk details the filtering, randomization, and sampling processes used to curate the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), ensuring high-quality, representative Turkish-language functional requirements across six business domains, with examples provided to illustrate the dataset's scope and alignment with OWASP ASVS security classes.\n\nCONTENT: 10 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n3.

The Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD) used in the study is explicitly mapped to 11 OWASP ASVS categories (V2–V13), enabling multi-label classification of implicit security requirements. This alignment ensures that security requirements are categorized based on real-world, actionable standards, which is critical for automating security compliance in early-phase software development.

In contrast, STRIDE is a threat modeling framework that focuses on identifying potential threats (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, etc.) rather than classifying security requirements into actionable categories. OWASP ASVS is better suited for tasks requiring detailed classification and mapping of functional requirements to specific security controls, as demonstrated by the study's focus on automating the classification process using machine learning models and prompt-based approaches.

Additionally, the OWASP ASVS framework supports the ""Security by Design"" and ""Shift-Left"" strategies by enabling developers to map functional specifications to security controls before coding begins, which is more aligned with the goals of the ASRD dataset and the study's methodology.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to']","The study categorized 'Asset Handover' requirements under **Authentication (V2)** and **Access Control (V4)** because, in an industrial context, an asset handover involves a legally binding transfer of custody. This process necessitates:

1. **Authentication (V2)**: To verify the identity of the involved parties.
2. **Access Control (V4)**: To ensure that only authorized individuals have the authority to perform the handover.

These classifications reflect the need to verify identity and authority during the handover process, which are critical for maintaining security and compliance. The study highlights that such implicit security requirements are often overlooked by keyword-based approaches, but domain experts and advanced models like LLMs can identify these dependencies effectively.

What is the 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work?,"['CONTEXT: **Future Directions for Addressing Data Sparsity in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk outlines proposed advancements, including dynamic few-shot selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-AI collaborative frameworks, and synthetic data generation, to overcome challenges of data sparsity and improve the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","The 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work is a system designed to enhance the classification of rare security requirements in SRS documents by integrating human expertise with AI capabilities. This framework involves multiple agents working collaboratively:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Agent**: Dynamically selects the most relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. This ensures that the AI is grounded in contextually appropriate data.
   
2. **Assessment Agent**: Evaluates classification confidence and consistency, flagging ambiguous or high-risk cases. For such cases, it requests focused clarifications from a human expert.

3. **Supervisor Agent**: Consolidates inputs from the retrieval and assessment agents, ensuring that the final labels align with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the broader project context.

4. **Optimization Agent**: Learns from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time. This reduces manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security requirements.

This framework emphasizes a **Human-in-the-Loop** approach, where human oversight is integrated into the AI-driven process to handle ambiguous or high-risk cases effectively. Over time, the system aims to reduce reliance on human intervention by learning from these interactions, thereby improving its performance and efficiency.
