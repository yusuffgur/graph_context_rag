Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual methods, and highlights the potential of AI-based NLP approaches, supported by frameworks like OWASP ASVS, to address these gaps.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels.

It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides a detailed example of a zero-shot prompt designed for classifying and analyzing project requirements based on the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr categories, showcasing how large language models (LLMs) can be guided to perform security-focused requirement classification with explanations, aligning with the broader study\'s focus on automating security requirements analysis.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 43\nAdvanced Intelligent Systems 6(7):2300798\nWen SF, Katt B (2023) A quantitative security evaluation and analysis model\nfor web applications based on owasp application security verification stan-\ndard.

The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023).

However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012).

Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.']","The primary motivation for integrating security during the requirements analysis phase is to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulnerabilities, and minimize the high costs associated with addressing security issues later in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification, highlighting the challenges of addressing the ""Long Tail"" problem in imbalanced datasets.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023).

1. **Implicit Nature of Security Requirements**: Security requirements are often not explicitly stated but are embedded within functional descriptions. For example, a simple requirement like ""The system will allow the user to print documents"" carries implicit security needs such as user authorization, session management, and logging. Identifying these implicit dependencies requires substantial expertise and effort.

2. **Error-Prone and Inconsistent Process**: Manually identifying and validating the network of implicit security dependencies across thousands of requirements is prone to errors, inconsistencies, and lacks scalability.

3. **Dependence on Domain Expertise**: The process heavily relies on domain-specific knowledge and expertise, which is both scarce and costly. This includes creating templates, determining classification levels, and mapping requirements to security controls.

4. **Dataset Limitations**: The lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets for training and validating automated methods further complicates the task. Existing datasets often lack granularity, realism, or sufficient annotations to support the identification of implicit security requirements.

5. **Subjectivity and Ambiguity**: The subjective nature of defining security requirements and the inherent ambiguity in separating security-related requirements from non-security ones add to the complexity.

6. **Scalability Issues**: The manual approach is not scalable for large-scale industrial projects, where thousands of requirements need to be analyzed.

These challenges highlight the need for automated approaches, such as AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, to address the limitations of manual Security Requirements Analysis (SRA).

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the limitations of existing security frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE, NIST SSDF, Common Criteria) for fine-grained security requirement classification and highlights the suitability of OWASP ASVS for this purpose. It also reviews related work on security requirement datasets, emphasizing the need for high-quality benchmarks like PROMISEExp to advance automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability. In response to this need, the research community has developed\na limited number of foundational datasets for security requirements analysis,\neach offering distinct advantages and limitations. The three most represen-\ntative datasets are briefly described below, and their key characteristics are\nsummarized in Table 1.\n2.3.1 PROMISEExp\nIntroduced by Lima et al. (Lima et al., 2019), to expand the well-established\ntera-PROMISE repository, this dataset resulted from a systematic curation\nof publicly available SRS documents. The curation process relied on man-\nual extraction and expert consensus to ensure high-quality annotations.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning.

Which security standard was used to annotate the dataset?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the curation and preprocessing of the Agency Security Requirements Dataset (ASRD), detailing the multi-stage pipeline used to extract, anonymize, and prepare real-world Turkish-language Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents for multi-label security annotation, while addressing gaps in prior datasets.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 9\n2.3.3 Electronic Health Domain Dataset\nThis corpus focuses on the electronic healthcare industry, a sector defined\nby stringent regulatory and high-assurance demands (Riaz et al., 2014). The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD, following the MATTER cycle framework. It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews re-\nlated work on NLP-based requirements classification, security frameworks, and\nexisting security datasets. Section 3 describes the curation and expert anno-\ntation of the ASRD and summarizes its key characteristics. Section 4 outlines\nthe experimental setup and classification methods, including fine-tuned BERT\nmodels and prompt-based approaches. Section 5 reports the experimental re-\nsults. Section 6 discusses the findings and their implications, with a com-\nparative analysis of fine-tuning and prompting strategies. Section 7 examines', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, the handling of class imbalances in security requirement categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography and File Handling), and the inclusion of true negatives to ensure realistic model evaluation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: This chunk introduces the motivation and objectives of the study, emphasizing the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents and proposing a data-driven methodology using the newly developed ASRD dataset and advanced NLP models to automate this process.\n\nCONTENT: Noname manuscript No.\n(will be inserted by the editor)\nImplicit Security Requirements Classification\nwith Large Language Models Using the OWASP\nApplication Security Verification Standard: A\nShift-Left Approach.\nYusuf G¨ ur·Tu˘ gba Ta¸ skaya Temizel·\nBanu G¨ unel Kılı¸ c\nReceived: date / Accepted: date\nAbstractCybersecurity threats require early integration of security, starting\nfrom the requirements analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the limitations of existing security frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, STRIDE, NIST SSDF, Common Criteria) for fine-grained security requirement classification and highlights the suitability of OWASP ASVS for this purpose. It also reviews related work on security requirement datasets, emphasizing the need for high-quality benchmarks like PROMISEExp to advance automated classification research.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 7\nSeveral established frameworks, while influential, are not designed for this\npurpose. MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls. Previous studies have suc-\ncessfully applied ASVS in requirements and design contexts ( Lukasiewicz and\nCyga´ nska, 2019; Tan et al., 2021; Wen and Katt, 2023). Its consistency with\nstandards such as NIST 800-63B supports its use in both academic research\nand industrial settings.\n2.3 Related Work on Security Related Requirement Datasets\nHigh-quality benchmark datasets are essential for developing automated clas-\nsification models, ensuring research reproducibility, and assessing model gen-\neralizability.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency.

The\ndataset’s strength lies in its rigorous multi-stage annotation methodology,\nwhich utilized independent researchers and a mediator to ensure high inter-\nannotator agreement. While it provides a large-scale, authentic resource for\nhealthcare-specific tasks, its narrow focus may limit the generalizability of\nmodels to other industries, and its high-level security objectives may be too\ncoarse for detailed technical analysis.\n2.3.4 Summary of Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, these datasets vary significantly in their suitability\nfor tasks ranging from general non-functional requirement (NFR) classifica-\ntion to detailed security analysis. Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD, following the MATTER cycle framework.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments.

It also provides sample requirements to illustrate the dataset's diversity and focus on implicit security dependencies.\n\nCONTENT: 10 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n3. Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of models across OWASP ASVS classes, highlighting challenges with rare categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, File Handling) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and threats to validity related to linguistic diversity and generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers.

In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","The limitations of the PROMISE_exp dataset mentioned in the background are as follows:

1. **Small Size and Class Imbalance**: The dataset is relatively small in size, with only 969 requirements, and suffers from class imbalance. This ""High Dimension, Low Sample Size"" (HDLSS) nature, characterized by a high feature-to-instance ratio, restricts its suitability for training complex deep learning architectures.

2. **Single Security Class**: The dataset treats security as a single, high-level category, which limits its granularity and usefulness for fine-grained security requirement classification.

These limitations make the dataset less effective for modern research, particularly in addressing challenges like implicit security requirements and class imbalance.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. Its orga-\nnization into distinct, actionable security categories supports direct mapping\nto functional and non-functional security controls.

This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

OWASP ASVS, to address these gaps.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

Each identified requirement was treated as a single processing unit, preserving the structural integrity of the original specification.

2. **Anonymization**: A semi-automated anonymization process was implemented to protect sensitive data.

The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2.

It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides detailed descriptions of OWASP ASVS verification categories (V4–V13) and their associated security requirements, along with guidelines for categorizing requirements based on specific operations (e.g., CRUD, storage, transfer) and few-shot examples for classification in the context of the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: V4, Erişim Kontrolleri (Access Controls) - Covers requirements related to authorization, role management, \nand preventing unauthorized access to resources (e.g., ASVS 4.0). \nV5, ""Doğrulama, Temizleme ve Şifreleme"" (Verification, Cleaning, and Encryption) - Covers requirements \nrelated to input validation, output encoding, data sanitization, and cryptographic protection of sensitive \ndata (e.g., ASVS 5.0). \nV6, Depolanmış Kriptografi (Stored Cryptography) - Covers requirements for protecting data at rest using \ncryptography, including key management and secure storage of encryption keys (e.g., ASVS 6.0). \nV7, Hata Ayıklama ve Kayıt (Debugging and Logging) - Covers requirements related to secure logging \npractices, error handling, and preventing information leakage through debug information (e.g., ASVS 7.0). \nV8, Veri Koruma (Data Protection) - Covers requirements related to data at rest and in transit protection, \nincluding encryption, backups, and data retention policies (e.g., ASVS 8.0). \nV9, İletişim (Communication) - Covers requirements related to secure communication protocols, protecting \nagainst network attacks, and ensuring data integrity during transmission (e.g., ASVS 9.0). \nV10, Zararlı Kod (Malicious Code) - Covers requirements related to preventing and mitigating the risk of \nmalicious code injection, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (e.g., ASVS 10.0). \nV12, Dosya ve Kaynakları (Files and Resources) - Covers requirements related to secure file handling, \naccess control to files and resources, and preventing directory traversal attacks (e.g., ASVS 12.0). \nV13, API ve Web Servisleri (API and Web Services) - Covers requirements specific to securing web \nservices, APIs, and microservices, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and error \nhandling (e.g., ASVS 13.0). \n \n********* \n \nExtra Information for Choosing Categories (Aligned with OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr): \n \nAccording to given descriptions for kind of requirements, we can decide categories as in PSV: \n \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Create operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Read operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Update operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Delete operation|1|1|1|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes User Types: usage of various user types as role management|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes Store: actions related to storage and backup of the assets at rest, e.g., backing up \nlog files|0|0|0|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|0| \nIf Requirement describes Transfer: actions related to transfer or sharing of the assets, e.g., sending data \nfrom one service to another|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes Upload and Download Files etc. operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|0|1|1|1|1| \nIf Requirement describes operation on sensitive data like personal, financial, health etc|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0| \n \n********* \n \nFew-Shot Examples (PSV): \n1|Sistem, yetkili kullanıcının hukuk dosyası türü kayıt etmesini sağlayacaktır.|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| Identity \nVerification (V2): The requirement specifies ""yetkili kullanıcı,"" implying a need for authentication to verify \nthe user\'s identity and ensure they are authorized to perform this action.Session Management (V3):  \nManaging the user session after authentication is essential to maintain the user\'s authenticated status and \nprevent unauthorized acces.

It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides details on the BERT-based models used in the study, including their architectures, training data, and rationale for selection, as well as the fine-tuning methodology employed to adapt these models for multi-label classification of security requirements in the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews re-\nlated work on NLP-based requirements classification, security frameworks, and\nexisting security datasets.

The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies. Fleiss’s Kappa coefficient of 0.82 was obtained\nacross the three annotators, indicating strong agreement that significantly\nexceeded random chance.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls.

We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, the handling of class imbalances in security requirement categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography and File Handling), and the inclusion of true negatives to ensure realistic model evaluation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME.

The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification, highlighting the challenges of addressing the ""Long Tail"" problem in imbalanced datasets.

On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

It achieved a **Macro-F1 score of 0.774** and a **Weighted-F1 score of 0.933**, which were much lower than the fine-tuned BERT models and state-of-the-art LLMs. The Naive Baseline model struggled particularly with minority classes, achieving an **F1 score of 0.00** for underrepresented categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources). This indicates that the model primarily relied on predicting the majority class and failed to generalize to less frequent categories.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical.

This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to']","The prompting strategy used for the Few-Shot experiments involved incorporating labeled examples into the prompt to guide the model's behavior. Specifically, 30 training instances were selected to capture multi-label cases, cover all 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and reflect linguistic variation across different business domains. Persona-based prompting was also applied, instructing the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist to reduce output variance and ensure domain-specific responses. The final prompt structure was refined iteratively to improve instruction clarity, contextual grounding, and constraint formatting for machine-readability. 

This approach prioritized representativeness of examples over performance optimization, aiming for experimental control and cross-model comparability. However, static few-shot prompting showed limitations for underrepresented classes, as fixed examples often failed to generalize across diverse contexts.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes.

The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy.

Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, the handling of class imbalances in security requirement categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography and File Handling), and the inclusion of true negatives to ensure realistic model evaluation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 7 examines']","The 'Persona-Context-Constraint' prompt structure included the following specific elements:

1. **Persona**: The model was instructed to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist with extensive knowledge of the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr and secure software development practices. This persona was designed to ground the model's responses in professional domain expertise and reduce output variance.

2. **Context**: The context provided explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP ASVS categories and additional heuristic rules (e.g., mapping CRUD operations to specific security categories). This contextual anchoring ensured the model adhered to the specified standards and mitigated contextual bias.

3. **Constraint**: The prompts were formatted to stabilize the output structure for machine-readability. This included ensuring the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields and adhering to a specific PSV (Pipe Separated Values) format for input and output. The constraints also required the model to classify requirements into OWASP ASVS categories and provide concise explanations for each classification.

These elements were iteratively refined to improve instruction clarity, contextual grounding, and output consistency.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk provides a background on prior work in NLP-based techniques for software requirements classification, highlighting the evolution from traditional supervised learning methods to advanced transformer-based models like BERT and SecureBERT, and discussing the challenges of classifying implicit security requirements due to their abstract nature and reliance on domain expertise.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks. It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification, highlighting the challenges of addressing the ""Long Tail"" problem in imbalanced datasets. It also details the expert-driven annotation process, potential biases, and the rationale behind test set and model selection to ensure realistic and complex evaluations.\n\nCONTENT: 32 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 4:Minority vs. Majority Class Performance Gap.A comparative\nanalysis revealing that while advanced LLMs and fine-tuned models achieve\nnear-parity on Majority Classes (Blue), a significant performance gap remains\non Minority Classes (Red), underscoring the “Long Tail” challenge in SRE.\nAnnotation was performed by three experienced cybersecurity experts.\nWhile their domain knowledge ensured quality, the small annotator pool may\nintroduce subjective bias and limit the range of interpretations. This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching. For the model suite,\nthey prioritized architectures with advanced reasoning capabilities, hypothe-\nsizing that these specific technical features are essential for the multi-step de-\nduction required in security requirements engineering. Although the experts']","'Contextual Anchoring' in the context of this study's prompt engineering refers to a strategy used to mitigate contextual bias in large language models (LLMs). This bias occurs when a model relies on its general training data rather than the specific task definitions provided. To address this, the study injected explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP ASVS classes and heuristic ""Extra Information"" rules directly into the prompt's context window. These rules included mappings, such as CRUD operations to specific security categories based on guidelines. By embedding this information into the prompt, the models were directed to adhere to the specified standards, resulting in more consistent classifications of implicit security requirements.

This approach was particularly important for ensuring experimental control and cross-model comparability, as it prioritized adherence to standards over optimizing performance metrics. The study highlights that this method helped guide the models to follow the OWASP ASVS taxonomy more accurately, especially in scenarios where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting struggled due to class imbalance or underrepresented categories.

Which statistical test was used to reject the null hypothesis regarding classifier performance?,"['CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superior performance of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of these differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

The Friedman test was employed to compare the distributions of classifier performance scores across 11 OWASP ASVS security classes, treating them as independent domains. The test yielded a statistic of 188.103 with a p-value of 2.38×10⁻²⁸, which rejected the null hypothesis (p < 0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences across the models were statistically significant.

Following this, pairwise comparisons between models were conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, which is a non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test. This test was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle outliers without being disproportionately skewed, ensuring reliable comparisons of classifier performance.

The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies.

What does the 'zone of failure' in the performance heatmap refer to?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance analysis of models across OWASP ASVS classes, highlighting challenges with rare categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography, File Handling) through heatmaps and gap analysis, while addressing dataset limitations and threats to validity related to linguistic diversity and generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: 30 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 2: Critical Difference (CD) diagram visualizing the statistical comparison\nof classifiers. The horizontal axis represents the average rank of each model\nacross all 11 OWASP ASVS classes (lower ranks indicate better performance).\nThe Critical Difference (CD = 10.46) represents the minimum difference in\naverage rank required for two models to be considered statistically significantly\ndifferent atp <0.05.\n5.6 Comparative Visualization Analysis\nTo complement the statistical rankings, we visualized the performance land-\nscape across all 20 model configurations.\nHeatmap Analysis: Figure 3 shows F1-scores by class. Requirements related\nto V2 (Authentication), V3 (Session Management), and V4 (Access Control)\nare handled well by nearly all models, with scores typically above 0.95. These\ncategories are common and appear consistently across training sources. In\ncontrast, V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) show low\nscores across the board, including for GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Pro. This pat-\ntern points to a systematic difficulty with sparse categories rather than a\nweakness of a particular model.\nGap Analysis: Figure 4 contrasts average performance on frequent and in-\nfrequent classes. Fine-tuned models such as SecureBERT and BERT-Multilingual\nperform better on rare classes, with F1-scores around 0.70–0.80. Zero-shot\nLLMs perform poorly in these cases, often below 0.30. Few-shot prompting\nimproves results for some models, such as Gemini 2.0, but the gap remains\nsubstantial.\n6 Threats to Validity\nOur dataset consists of 2,652 requirements derived from six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents.

The visualization highlights\nthe “zone of failure” (red) for classes V6 and V12 across models, contrasting\nwith the high performance (green) on ubiquitous classes like V2 and V4.\nis limited, potential bias was mitigated by strategically selecting projects from\nsix distinct business domains: Construction, Legal, Education, Software, Meet-\ning Management, and Accommodation. This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Metrics for Security Verification Categories and LLM Evaluation**: This chunk presents detailed precision, recall, and

How many person-hours were required to annotate the ASRD?,"['CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data preparation effort and model performance across fine-tuned BERT models and LLM approaches, highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world contexts.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est. Setup Effort Best Macro-F1\nBERT Fine-Tuning High (∼2,600 ex) High (267 hours)0.942\nLLM Few-Shot Low (∼30 ex) Low (<10 hours)0.941\nLLM Zero-Shot None Minimal (<2 hours) 0.890\nLLM Few-Shot approach (using Gemini 2.0) achieved a similar performance\n(Macro-F1 0.941) while requiring only the selection of a small number of in-\ncontext examples (approx. 30 examples per prompt).\nThis comparison points to diminishing returns from large-scale annotation\nwhen capable LLMs are available. Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, the handling of class imbalances in security requirement categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography and File Handling), and the inclusion of true negatives to ensure realistic model evaluation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME. When the two annotators disagreed on a\nrequirement, it was resolved through a structured process:\n–Both annotators presented their choice and their reasons.\n–The senior expert reviewed both positions against the guideline.\n–If the guideline clearly supported one choice, that one was used. If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: **Annotation Process and Quality Assurance for ASRD**: This chunk details the iterative annotation process for the ASRD dataset, including pilot and independent annotation phases, SME-led adjudication, guideline refinements, and the calculation of Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) metrics to ensure high-quality and consistent annotations.\n\nCONTENT: 16 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n(1) original text and annotations were recoverable, (2) clear documenta-\ntion was maintained, (3) annotation quality was consistently high. The\nannotation template included fields for the software requirement text, se-\nlected OWASP labels, and annotator comments or questions. All versions\nof the guideline and annotation documents were preserved to track revi-\nsions based on annotator feedback. For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency. IAA\nscores were instrumental in identifying instances of disagreement among\nannotators, thereby highlighting areas where the guidelines might require\nfurther clarification or where ambiguous requirement phrasings contributed\nto annotation discrepancies.

Filtering: The initial extraction yielded 3,264 items. To ensure the qual-\nity of the dataset, domain experts conducted a rigorous manual filtering\npass to remove 612 items. This exclusion process went beyond simple for-\nmatting artifacts (such as headers or tables of contents). We specifically\nremoved non-functional administrative clauses that addressed the vendor\nrather than the system (e.g., “The contractor must provide training man-\nuals”), project management constraints (e.g., “The project must be deliv-\nered by Q3”), and requirements with ambiguous scope that lacked clear\nverification criteria.\n4.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase.

Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.']","The annotation process for the ASRD dataset required **267 person-hours** of expert time, as stated in the provided Context.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”).

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Model Performance**: This chunk discusses the optimization of BERT models through systematic grid search and early stopping to prevent overfitting, as well as the use of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superior performance of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of these differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to']","The estimated setup effort for the LLM Few-Shot approach is significantly lower compared to BERT fine-tuning. Specifically:

- **BERT Fine-Tuning**: Requires high data preparation (approximately 2,600 examples) and a substantial setup effort of around 267 hours.
- **LLM Few-Shot**: Requires minimal data preparation (approximately 30 examples) and a much lower setup effort of less than 10 hours.

This demonstrates that the LLM Few-Shot approach offers a more resource-efficient alternative while achieving nearly identical performance (Macro-F1 of 0.941 for LLM Few-Shot vs. 0.942 for BERT fine-tuning). This makes it particularly advantageous in industrial settings where reducing annotation and setup time is critical.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Comparison of Models for Implicit Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk focuses on the statistical analysis and performance comparison of baseline, fine-tuned, and few-shot/zero-shot LLM models, highlighting significant differences in their ability to classify implicit security requirements, with SecureBERT and Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot emerging as top performers.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 29\nThe analysis (Table 8) highlights the significant pairwise contrasts and\nreveals important performance distinctions:\n–Baseline vs. Advanced Models: The Naive Baseline was consistently out-\nperformed by the advanced models. The difference between the Baseline\nand models such as SecureBERT (p <0.001) and Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot\n(p <0.001) was statistically significant, confirming that the high Weighted-\nF1 scores of these models reflect genuine learning beyond simple majority-\nclass prediction.\n–Fine-Tuning vs. Zero-Shot LLMs: Fine-tuned models like SecureBERT\ndemonstrated statistically significant performance distinctions (p <0.001)\nwhen compared to general-purpose LLMs operating in a zero-shot setting,\nsuch as GPT-4o (p <0.001) and Llama 3 70B (p <0.001). This indi-\ncates that without in-context examples, domain-specific fine-tuning retains\na measurable statistical advantage.\n–Fine-Tuning vs. Few-Shot State-of-the-Art: The pairwise comparison be-\ntween the best fine-tuned model (SecureBERT) and the best LLM ap-\nproach (Gemini 2.0 Few-Shot) yielded ap-value of 0.102. This value is not\nstatistically significant at theα= 0.05 level, supporting our finding that\nfew-shot prompting with state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively match the\nperformance of specialized, fine-tuned BERT models in this domain.\nTable 8: Significant Pairwise Differences (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test)\nModel A Model B Statistic p-value\nNaive Baseline SecureBERT 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline BERT Turkish 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline Gemini 2.0 (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nNaive Baseline Gemini 2.0 Pro (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o Mini (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o Mini (Zero-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o (Zero-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT GPT-4o (Few-Shot) 0.0 0.00098\nSecureBERT Gemini 2.0 (Zero-Shot) 25.0 0.501\nSecureBERT Gemini 2.0 (Few-Shot) 14.5 0.102\nTo visualize the relative performance and statistical significance groups\nof all evaluated models, we constructed a Critical Difference (CD) diagram\n(Figure 2) using the Nemenyi post-hoc test.\nIn the CD diagram, models are arranged along the horizontal axis accord-\ning to their average rank. The best performing models, such as Gemini 2.0\nPro (Few-Shot) and BERT-Multilingual, appear on the left (lowest ranks).\nA horizontal bar connects groups of models that are not statistically signifi-\ncantly different from one another. The wide span of the CD bar (10.46) reflects\nthe high number of models compared (23) relative to the number of datasets\n(11). Despite this conservative threshold, the diagram clearly separates the\ntop-tier models (Fine-tuned BERTs and Few-Shot Gemini/GPT-4o) from the\nlower-performing group (Naive Baseline, Zero-Shot

of security, starting\nfrom the requirements analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC). However, security requirements in Software Requirements Specifica-\ntion (SRS) documents are often implicitly embedded, making their manual\nidentification time-consuming, error-prone, and reliant on specialized exper-\ntise. The accurate classification of security requirements (SR) is important for\neffective resource allocation and risk management in software development.\nAutomated tools to extract implicit security requirements are lacking, largely\ndue to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets in Security Requirements En-\ngineering (SRE). This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to automate\nthe classification of implicit security requirements in SRS documents, sup-\nporting the early and systematic integration of security into software systems.\nWe introduce a novel multi-label corpus, the Agency Security Requirements\nDataset (ASRD), derived from 2,652 real-world requirement statements from\nsix diverse documents and annotated using a high-granularity taxonomy based\non the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) V2-V13\nand the MATTER cycle annotation framework by three cybersecurity experts.\nUsing this dataset, we evaluate both supervised fine-tuned BERT variants\n(such as SecureBERT) and general-purpose large-language models (LLMs) in-\ncluding Gemma, GPT, DeepSeek, Meta Llama, and Gemini under zero-shot\nand few-shot settings.

Given the multi-label nature of the task, Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) Loss was used as the primary objective function.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost.

The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.']","The **bert-base-turkish-cased** model was included in the study to explore the performance of a model pre-trained on a language with a different morphological structure than English.

We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase. Annotation rules\nwere based on OWASP ASVS categories V2–V13 and refined iteratively\nusing example annotations. Following best practices suggested by Cohen\n(Cohen et al., 2005), the guidelines and annotation documents ensured:', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: Acknowledgments, Funding, and Ethical Declarations: This chunk provides details on the funding sources, ethical considerations, author contributions, and data availability for the study, emphasizing transparency and the collaborative efforts of subject matter experts in annotating the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: 38 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nASRD into English.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite. Rather than selecting data or models arbitrarily, these experts\ncurated a test set containing the most complex, “implicit” security scenarios\nto challenge the models beyond simple pattern matching.

Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Effort vs. Performance and Validation of ASRD Dataset**: This chunk discusses the trade-offs between data preparation effort and model performance across fine-tuned BERT models and LLM approaches, highlights the advantages of the ASRD dataset over existing benchmarks, and emphasizes the challenges of implicit security requirement elicitation in real-world contexts.\n\nCONTENT: 34 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nTable 9: Comparison of Effort vs. Performance across Approaches\nApproach Data Requirement Est.

Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime.

To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

This semantic diversity ensures that\nthe models are evaluated on a broad vocabulary and varied functional contexts\nrather than a single industry vertical. A specific consideration regarding the\nexternal validity of this study is that the ASRD is a Turkish-language corpus\nwhich allows for the evaluation of automated tools in linguistically diverse\nindustrial contexts.\nFurthermore, because security requirements (e.g., Authentication, Log-\nging) represent cross-cutting concerns that apply universally across software\nsystems, we believe the fundamental patterns captured in the ASRD are trans-\nferable to other industries. Our current evaluation used a stratified split across\nthe entire dataset, meaning requirements from all six source projects are\npresent in the training, validation, and test sets. However, we acknowledge\nthat this approach does not fully measure the models’ ability to generalize to\nentirely new projects with different authors or linguistic styles, as the test set\nis not completely “unseen” in terms of project context.']","The ""Long Tail"" challenge described in the discussion refers to the significant performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification. This issue arises due to the imbalanced nature of datasets, where certain security categories (e.g., Authentication or Access Control) are well-represented, while others (e.g., Stored Cryptography or File Handling) are underrepresented. These minority classes often contain critical security vulnerabilities but are difficult for models to learn and generalize due to their sparse representation.

The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that traditional supervised learning and even few-shot prompting struggle to generalize from limited examples. For instance, static few-shot prompting fails to capture the context-dependent nature of minority classes, leading to poor performance on rare, high-variance security requirements. This ""long-tail"" distribution is a persistent issue in security requirements engineering (SRE) and reflects the natural distribution of security concerns in industrial contexts.

Efforts to address this challenge include strategies like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dynamic few-shot selection, and synthetic data injection to improve model performance on underrepresented classes. These approaches aim to provide more targeted and contextually relevant examples to help models better classify rare security requirements.

It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window.

The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

1. **Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG**:  
   - Future systems should dynamically retrieve explicit definitions and verification criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground the classification of rare security requirements.  
   - Instead of relying on fixed examples, a retriever should select the most semantically similar valid requirements from the training set to serve as in-context examples for a specific query.  
   - This approach ensures that the model is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g., ""encryption"" vs. ""hashing"") rather than generic class examples.  

2. **Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework**:  
   - A multi-agent framework is proposed where a retrieval-augmented agent dynamically selects the most relevant annotated requirements using semantic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples.  
   - A second agent would assess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases for human expert intervention.  
   - A supervisor agent would consolidate inputs to ensure final labels align with OWASP ASVS taxonomy and project context.  
   - An optimization agent would learn from human interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security requirements.  

3. **Synthetic Data Injection**:  
   - A Teacher-Student Data Generation loop is recommended, where high-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly trigger classifications for rare security classes (e.g., V6/V12).  
   - These synthetic samples can populate the training set, enabling smaller supervised models (e.g., BERT) to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.  

These advancements aim to address dataset sparsity, improve classification accuracy, and enhance model generalizability for rare security classes.

What is the proposed 'Teacher-Student Data Generation' loop?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Advancements in LLMs and Security Automation**: This chunk discusses the role of transformer-based models and LLMs in automating security tasks like requirements classification, emphasizing their emergent capabilities, reliance on high-quality datasets, and the importance of explainability and standardized evaluation frameworks for reliable and domain-specific security engineering.\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated.

It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', ""CONTEXT: This chunk provides references and citations related to foundational works, methodologies, and advancements in natural language processing, security requirements classification, and large language models, supporting the study's exploration of automated security requirements analysis and the development of the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: 40 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nDevlin J, Chang MW, Lee K, Toutanova K (2019) Bert: Pre-training of deep\nbidirectional transformers for language understanding.

To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.']","The proposed ""Teacher-Student Data Generation"" loop is a method aimed at addressing dataset sparsity and improving the classification of rare security requirements. It involves using high-reasoning large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 or Gemini 2.5 Pro, to generate diverse synthetic security requirements. These synthetic samples are designed to implicitly trigger specific classifications (e.g., V6/V12 categories) and are then used to populate the training set. This allows smaller supervised models, like BERT, to learn robust decision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation. 

This approach is part of a broader strategy to enhance supervised models' performance in scenarios where labeled data is limited or imbalanced, particularly in the context of security requirements classification.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of Prompt Engineering Strategies for LLMs in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk delves into the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of LLMs for classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly for underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148.

For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.']","Experimental LLMs, such as Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, were included in the evaluation to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that were not yet available in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written.

The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12.

This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores.

This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025).

The use of experimental or preview models, which are subject to deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, poses a challenge because other researchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future. This lack of stability in the experimental endpoints undermines the ability to replicate results, which is a key aspect of internal validity. To mitigate this, the study documented the exact model identifier strings used during the data collection window, ensuring transparency about the specific technological generation evaluated, though this does not guarantee future access to the same snapshots.

Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical.

This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

Specifically:

1. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Fine-tuned models, such as SecureBERT, consistently outperformed zero-shot LLMs, demonstrating a measurable statistical advantage (p < 0.001).
   - Few-shot LLMs, particularly Gemini 2.0, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.941, which is comparable to the best fine-tuned BERT model's Macro-F1 score of 0.942. This indicates that few-shot prompting can match the performance of specialized, resource-intensive fine-tuned models.

2. **Scalability and Resource Efficiency**:
   - Few-shot LLMs represent a practical and resource-saving strategy for automating the identification of implicit security requirements, as they require less computational cost compared to fine-tuning.

3. **Challenges**:
   - Despite the near-parity in performance for majority classes, both LLMs and fine-tuned models struggled with minority classes, highlighting the ""Long Tail"" challenge in imbalanced datasets.

These findings suggest that while fine-tuned models remain slightly superior in certain contexts, few-shot LLMs offer a scalable and efficient alternative for tasks requiring domain-specific classification.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Advancements in LLMs and Security Automation**: This chunk discusses the role of transformer-based models and LLMs in automating security tasks like requirements classification, emphasizing their emergent capabilities, reliance on high-quality datasets, and the importance of explainability and standardized evaluation frameworks for reliable and domain-specific security engineering.\n\nCONTENT: 6 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nBeyond requirements classification, security research has also turned to\ntask-specific models for narrowly defined problems. For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of Prompt Engineering Strategies for LLMs in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk delves into the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of LLMs for classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly for underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the']","The ""pre-train, prompt, and predict"" paradigm is a modern approach to utilizing large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Unlike the traditional ""pre-train, fine-tune"" method, this paradigm leverages prompt engineering to guide pre-trained models toward task-specific outputs without modifying their weights or architecture. 

In this paradigm:
1. **Pre-train**: The model is trained on a massive corpus of general-purpose data to develop a broad understanding of language.
2. **Prompt**: Carefully designed textual inputs (prompts) are used to steer the model's behavior for specific tasks. This can include:
   - **Zero-shot prompting**: Using the model directly without task-specific training.
   - **Few-shot prompting**: Including a small number of labeled examples in the prompt to help the model learn task patterns.
3. **Predict**: The model generates task-specific outputs based on the provided prompt.

This approach is particularly useful in scenarios with limited labeled data and avoids the computational cost of fine-tuning. Various prompting strategies include:
- **Tuning-free prompting**: No model changes, suitable for zero-shot settings but requires complex prompt design.
- **Fixed-LLM prompt tuning**: Learning soft prompts while keeping the model fixed, effective for few-shot tasks but less interpretable.

MITRE ATT&ACK 2 framework is a threat-based model of adver-\nsary behaviors, not a taxonomy of software requirements. Microsoft’s STRIDE\noperates at a high level of abstraction (e.g., “Spoofing”, “Tampering”) which\nis useful for threat modeling but lacks the granularity needed for require-\nment classification (Khan et al., 2017). Similarly, the NIST Secure Software\nDevelopment Framework (SSDF) defines high-level secure process practices\nrather than atomic requirement categories (Souppaya et al., 2022), and the\nCommon Criteria (CC) 3 is a template-based framework designed for formal\ncertification, making it impractical for fine-grained, natural-language analysis\n(Infrastructure and Profile, 2002).\nIn contrast, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)4 Appli-\ncation Security Verification Standard (ASVS)5 is well suited to the objectives\nof this study. ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented\ntaxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In the healthcare domain, Schmeelk and Tao (Schmeelk\nand Tao, 2022) conducted a case study on mobile health applications.\nAs of 2024–2025, commercial security platforms and verification tools con-\ntinue to offer native support for ASVS 4.0.3 compliance templates and map-\npings (Reqview, 2016; JIT.io, 2024), with requirement managers, compliance\ntracking systems, and automated security testing platforms (SAST/DAST) ex-\nplicitly designed around the 4.0.3 control structure. Multiple government and\nregulatory bodies, including the Moroccan government’s Directorate General\nfor Information Systems Security (DGSSI), have formally adopted ASVS 4.0.3\nas the basis for their national application security verification frameworks as\nof October 2024 (DGSSI, 2024).\nAt the time this study was designed and conducted (2023–2025), ASVS\n4.0.3 was the latest stable, officially released version of the standard. Version\n4.0.3, released in October 2021, had achieved widespread adoption and had\nbeen serving as the industry-standard reference for application security verifi-\ncation across finance, healthcare, technology, and government sectors for mul-\ntiple years. The ASVS 5.0 major revision was only released on 30 May 2025,\nafter the empirical work for this research had been substantially completed.\nTherefore, this research’s use of ASVS 4.0.3 represents both a temporally ap-\npropriate choice at the time of study design and a durable contribution to the\nliterature that will remain relevant and comparable with prior ASVS-based\nwork for years to come.\nThe standard includes 14 main security classes given in Table 3. For this\nstudy, only 11 classes (V2–V10, V12-V13) were used. V1, V11, and V14 were\nexcluded as they are not inferable from functional or non-functional require-\nments. Each requirement can be mapped to more than one classes.\nTable 3: OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 Classes\nClass Id Class Name Definition\nV1 Architecture, Design and\nThreat Modeling\nThis class focuses on the security of the\napplication’s architecture, component\ndesign, and the process of identifying\nand mitigating threats throughout the\ndevelopment lifecycle.\nV2 Authentication This class deals with verifying the\nidentity of users, services, or applica-\ntions, ensuring that only authorized\nentities can access specific functionali-\nties or data.\nV3 Session Management This class covers the secure manage-\nment of user sessions, from creation\nto termination, including protection of\nsession identifiers and prevention of\nsession-related attacks.\nV4 Access Control This class ensures that users can only\naccess the data and functions for which\nthey are explicitly authorized, enforc-\ning the principle of least privilege.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of identifying implicit security requirements in software systems, emphasizing the limitations of existing datasets and manual methods, and highlights the potential of AI-based NLP approaches, supported by frameworks like OWASP ASVS, to address these gaps.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 3\n“The system will allow the user to print documents,” carries numerous implicit\nsecurity needs, including verifying user authorization, maintaining a valid ses-\nsion, and recording the action for accountability. These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process. This approach enables the\nearly identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, which is both more effi-\n1 https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides detailed descriptions of OWASP ASVS categories (V2–V13) and their associated security requirements, along with guidelines for classifying requirements based on specific operations (e.g., CRUD, file handling, sensitive data) and an output format for structured classification.\n\nCONTENT: 3.0). \nV4, Erişim Kontrolleri (Access Controls) - Covers requirements related to authorization, role management, \nand preventing unauthorized access to resources (e.g., ASVS 4.0). \nV5, ""Doğrulama, Temizleme ve Şifreleme"" (Verification, Cleaning, and Encryption) - Covers requirements \nrelated to input validation, output encoding, data sanitization, and cryptographic protection of sensitive \ndata (e.g., ASVS 5.0). \nV6, Depolanmış Kriptografi (Stored Cryptography) - Covers requirements for protecting data at rest using \ncryptography, including key management and secure storage of encryption keys (e.g., ASVS 6.0). \nV7, Hata Ayıklama ve Kayıt (Debugging and Logging) - Covers requirements related to secure logging \npractices, error handling, and preventing information leakage through debug information (e.g., ASVS 7.0). \nV8, Veri Koruma (Data Protection) - Covers requirements related to data at rest and in transit protection, \nincluding encryption, backups, and data retention policies (e.g., ASVS 8.0). \nV9, İletişim (Communication) - Covers requirements related to secure communication protocols, protecting \nagainst network attacks, and ensuring data integrity during transmission (e.g., ASVS 9.0). \nV10, Zararlı Kod (Malicious Code) - Covers requirements related to preventing and mitigating the risk of \nmalicious code injection, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (e.g., ASVS 10.0). \nV12, Dosya ve Kaynakları (Files and Resources) - Covers requirements related to secure file handling, \naccess control to files and resources, and preventing directory traversal attacks (e.g., ASVS 12.0). \nV13, API ve Web Servisleri (API and Web Services) - Covers requirements specific to securing web \nservices, APIs, and microservices, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and error \nhandling (e.g., ASVS 13.0). \n \n********* \n \nExtra Information for Choosing Categories (Aligned with OWASP ASVS 4.0.3-tr): \n \nAccording to given descriptions for kind of requirements, we can decide categories as in PSV: \n \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Create operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Read operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Update operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|1|1|1|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes a CRUD operation and if it is Delete operation|1|1|1|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes User Types: usage of various user types as role management|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| \nIf Requirement describes Store: actions related to storage and backup of the assets at rest, e.g., backing up \nlog files|0|0|0|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|0| \nIf Requirement describes Transfer: actions related to transfer or sharing of the assets, e.g., sending data \nfrom one service to another|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|1| \nIf Requirement describes Upload and Download Files etc. operation|1|1|1|1|0|1|0|1|1|1|1| \nIf Requirement describes operation on sensitive data like personal, financial, health etc|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0| \n \n \n********* \nOutput (PSV- The requirements that are classified): \nWe need each requirement response in given format below within new line separator: \n<Requirement Number>|<Requirement \nDescription>|<V2>|<V3>|<V4>|<V5>|<V6>|<V7>|<V8>|<V9>|<V10>|<V12>|<V13>|<Explanation> format. \nand will contain: \n   - Requirement Number (integer) \n   - Requirement Description (string)']","The OWASP ASVS framework is preferred over STRIDE for this specific task because OWASP ASVS provides a detailed, verifiable, and developer-oriented taxonomy explicitly intended for requirement-level security analysis. STRIDE, while useful for high-level threat modeling, operates at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., ""Spoofing,"" ""Tampering"") and lacks the granularity needed for fine-grained security requirement classification. OWASP ASVS organizes security requirements into distinct, actionable categories (e.g., input validation, cryptography, error handling, API security), which can be directly mapped to functional and non-functional security controls. This makes it more suitable for tasks requiring precise classification and analysis of security requirements, as demonstrated in studies and datasets like ASRD.

Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel.

The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

challenges of classifying implicit security requirements due to their abstract nature and reliance on domain expertise.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks. It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superior performance of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of these differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of Prompt Engineering Strategies for LLMs in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk delves into the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of LLMs for classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly for underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring. We injected the explicit definitions of the 11 OWASP\nASVS classes and a set of heuristic “Extra Information” rules (e.g., map-\nping CRUD operations to specific security categories taken from guidelines)\ndirectly into the prompt’s context window. Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class.

What strategy was used to mitigate overfitting during BERT training?,"['CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Model Performance**: This chunk discusses the optimization of BERT models through systematic grid search and early stopping to prevent overfitting, as well as the use of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides details on the BERT-based models used in the study, including their architectures, training data, and rationale for selection, as well as the fine-tuning methodology employed to adapt these models for multi-label classification of security requirements in the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

We employed the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter,\n2019), an extension of the Adam optimizer with improved weight decay, uti-\nlizing a linear learning rate schedule with a warmup phase covering the first\n20% of training steps. This strategy stabilizes training in the initial epochs and\nimproves convergence. Given the multi-label nature of the task, Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) Loss was used as the primary objective function. Because the\nsecurity classes are unevenly distributed, the label assignment threshold (Deci-\nsion Threshold) was tuned rather than fixed at 0.5 to better balance precision\nand recall across categories.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Analysis of Prompt Engineering Strategies for LLMs in Security Requirements Classification**: This chunk delves into the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies on the performance of LLMs for classifying implicit security requirements, highlighting inconsistencies across models and categories, particularly for underrepresented classes, and comparing their results to fine-tuned BERT models.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 27\nFurthermore, to mitigate contextual bias, where a model might rely on\nits general training data rather than the specific task definitions, we utilized\nContextual Anchoring.

on prior work in NLP-based techniques for software requirements classification, highlighting the evolution from traditional supervised learning methods to advanced transformer-based models like BERT and SecureBERT, and discussing the challenges of classifying implicit security requirements due to their abstract nature and reliance on domain expertise.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks. It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.']","The strategy used to mitigate overfitting during BERT training involved monitoring validation loss and implementing early stopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. Additionally, the checkpoint achieving the lowest validation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test set. This approach ensured that the model did not overfit to the training data while maintaining optimal performance.

How did the study handle the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training?,"['CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: This chunk provides details on the BERT-based models used in the study, including their architectures, training data, and rationale for selection, as well as the fine-tuning methodology employed to adapt these models for multi-label classification of security requirements in the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 21\nTable 5: Details and Rationale of the BERT-based Models Used in the Study\nModel Name\n(Architecture /\nParameters)\nDescription, Training Data,\nand Source\nRationale in Study\nBERT Base (En-\nglish)\n(12 layers, 768\nhidden, 12 heads,\n110M params.)\nStandard BERT-base archi-\ntecture.

A sigmoid activation function was applied to this layer to\nproduce independent probabilities, facilitating multi-label classification. The\nfine-tuning process was performed from end-to-end; all weights were unfrozen\nand updated to adapt the models to the specific nuances of the security re-\nquirements text.\nThe models were trained using the PyTorch Lightning framework to ensure\nreproducibility. We employed the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter,\n2019), an extension of the Adam optimizer with improved weight decay, uti-\nlizing a linear learning rate schedule with a warmup phase covering the first\n20% of training steps. This strategy stabilizes training in the initial epochs and\nimproves convergence. Given the multi-label nature of the task, Binary Cross-\nEntropy (BCE) Loss was used as the primary objective function. Because the\nsecurity classes are unevenly distributed, the label assignment threshold (Deci-\nsion Threshold) was tuned rather than fixed at 0.5 to better balance precision\nand recall across categories.', 'CONTEXT: **Performance Analysis and Statistical Validation of Classifiers**: This chunk focuses on the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying security requirements, highlighting the superior performance of fine-tuned models, particularly in handling minority classes, and provides a statistical evaluation of these differences using the Friedman and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.\n\nCONTENT: 28 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nof 0.933 and Micro-F1 of 0.940, which show that the dataset’s class imbalance\nallows a trivial classifier to achieve high accuracy by ignoring minority classes.\nThe baseline model’s Macro-F1 score of 0.774 is significantly lower than the\nfine-tuned models (≈0.94) and its F1 score is 0.00 for the minority classes V6\n(Stored Cryptography) and V12 (Files and Resources) as anticipated. Mod-\nels like SecureBERT (based on RoBERTa) achieve an F1 of 0.734 on V6,\ndemonstrating that the deep learning models are successfully learning distinct\nfeatures for rare classes rather than merely exploiting the label distribution.\nOverall, the fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the LLMs in both\nzero-shot and few-shot configurations. The best fine-tuned model, bert-base-\nmultilingual-uncased, achieved a Macro-F1 score of 0.942, which is substan-\ntially higher than any LLM model’s score.\nThe top-performing LLM was Gemini 2.0, which in its few-shot configu-\nration reached a Macro-F1 score of 0.941. This score is on par with the best\nfine-tuned BERT model, indicating that few-shot prompting with a powerful\nLLM can match the performance of a specialized, fine-tuned model. However,\nmost other LLMs did not reach this level. For example, GPT-4o’s few-shot\nMacro-F1 score was only 0.814. In zero-shot tests, where no examples were\nprovided, the best LLM (Gemini 2.0) scored a Macro-F1 of 0.890. This score\nremains below the weakest fine-tuned BERT model, with fine-tuned models\nperforming best, followed by few-shot LLMs and then zero-shot LLMs.\n5.5 Statistical Evaluation of Classifiers Performance\nWe also examined whether the observed models’ performance differences were\nstatistically significant. Following the comparison framework of (Demˇ sar, 2006),\nwe compared the distributions of classifier performance scores. The 11 OWASP\nASVS security classes were treated as independent domains (stratified subsam-\nples from the main data set). The performance of the 20 evaluated classifiers\nwas assessed using the Friedman test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-\nrank tests.\nThe null hypothesis states that all classifiers perform equivalently and their\nrank distributions are identical. In our analysis, the Friedman test yielded a\nstatistic of 188.103 with ap-value of 2.38×10 −28. This result rejects the null\nhypothesis (p <0.05), confirming that the observed performance differences\nacross the models are non-random and statistically significant.\nFollowing the rejection of the null hypothesis, we proceeded to identify the\nspecific pairs of models that differ significantly. For these pairwise compar-\nisons, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Demˇ sar recommends the\nWilcoxon test as a “safe and robust” non-parametric alternative to the paired\nt-test for comparing two classifiers. Unlike the t-test, which assumes commen-\nsurability of differences and normality, the Wilcoxon test compares the ranks\nof the differences. This ensures that outliers (such as the extreme performance\ndrops observed in minority classes like V6 and V12) do not disproportionately\nskew the results.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: This chunk presents the test results and

Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1']","The study handled the uneven distribution of security classes during BERT training by employing several strategies:

1. **Stratified Sampling**: The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets using stratified sampling based on security class labels. This ensured that the label distributions were preserved across all splits, allowing the models to be exposed to minority classes during training and evaluation.

2. **Tuning the Decision Threshold**: Instead of using a fixed label assignment threshold (e.g., 0.5), the study tuned the decision threshold to better balance precision and recall across categories. This approach helped mitigate the impact of class imbalance.

3. **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss**: Given the multi-label nature of the task, BCE Loss was used as the primary objective function. This loss function is well-suited for handling imbalanced datasets as it evaluates each label independently.

4. **Focus on Minority Classes**: The test set was designed to include sufficient samples of minority classes (e.g., V6 and V12) to ensure their representation during evaluation. This allowed the study to assess the models' ability to handle rare classes effectively.

These strategies collectively aimed to address the challenges posed by the uneven distribution of security classes and improve the models' performance on underrepresented categories.

What is the key limitation of static few-shot prompting observed in the study?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk delves into the challenges and findings related to classifying implicit security requirements in Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), highlighting the limitations of static few-shot prompting for minority classes, the comparative performance of fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs, and the practical implications for automating security compliance in industrial contexts.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 35\nexplicitly stated as a functional transaction, our domain experts classified this\nrequirement across nearly all OWASP ASVS categories. In an industrial con-\ntext, an “asset handover” implies a legally binding transfer of custody, ne-\ncessitating Authentication (V2) and Access Control (V4) to verify identity\nand authority, Data Protection (V8) for non-repudiation, and Secure Logging\n(V7) for auditability. A purely keyword-based or explicit extraction approach\nwould likely miss these dependencies, leaving the module vulnerable. Our find-\nings demonstrate that LLMs, when prompted with few-shot examples, can\neffectively mimic this expert reasoning, bridging the gap between functional\nspecifications and security compliance.\nWhile the ASRD dataset accurately reflects the natural distribution of se-\ncurity requirements in industrial projects, the performance drop on minority\nclasses reveals distinct limitations across the two model architectures eval-\nuated. For the LLMs, the limitation lies in the rigidity of Static Few-Shot\nPrompting. Our results indicate that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples\n(Few-Shot) yielded inconsistent gains and, in cases like Llama-3 on V12, ac-\ntually degraded performance compared to Zero-Shot. This suggests that “im-\nplicit” requirements for minority classes are highly context-dependent. A fixed\nexample of V12 related to “file upload” does not help the LLM identify a V12\nrequirement related to “directory traversal.” Consequently, the models fail to\ngeneralize the concept of the minority class from static prompts, leading to\nthe low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) observed. This confirms that for rare, high-\nvariance security classes, static prompting is insufficient.\nOur study found that while fine-tuned BERT models provide strong results\n(up to 0.942 Macro-F1), few-shot prompting with a top-tier LLM like Gemini\n2.0 can achieve nearly identical performance (0.941 Macro-F1). This supports\nthe growing body of literature suggesting that in-context learning with large\nmodels can close the performance gap with task-specific fine-tuning, often\nwith significantly less labeled data. This shift from a traditional “pre-train,\nfine-tune” to a “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, as surveyed by\nLiu et al. (Liu et al., 2023a), offers a more agile and resource-efficient path\nfor deploying NLP solutions in specialized industrial contexts. Our results\nprovide a concrete example of this trend within the SRE domain and align\nwith findings given by Karlsson et.al (Karlsson et al., 2025).\nThese findings have immediate implications for the software industry, par-\nticularly in implementing “Security by Design” and “Shift-Left” strategies. In\ndiverse development environments—ranging from Agile teams to regulated sec-\ntors like healthcare or defense—developers often lack deep security expertise.\nThey focus on writing functional requirements (SRS) to meet business needs,\noften assuming security will be “added on” later. By automating the classi-\nfication of implicit security requirements using the method proposed in this\nstudy, organizations can instantly map functional specs to actionable OWASP\nASVS controls before a single line of code is written. Rather than replacing\nhuman oversight, this approach functions as a human-in-the-loop productiv-\nity multiplier. It serves as a sophisticated pre-screening tool that drastically\nspeeds up the initial analysis phase, allowing scarce cybersecurity experts to', 'CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Model Performance**: This chunk discusses the optimization of BERT models through systematic grid search and early stopping to prevent overfitting, as well as the use of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models.

Including this information in the\nprompt directed the models to follow the specified standard, resulting in more\nconsistent classifications.\nWhile alternative prompting strategies may yield different quantitative\noutcomes, this design prioritizes experimental control and cross-model compa-\nrability. Hence, the reported results reflect conservative estimates of prompt-\nbased performance rather than optimized upper bounds.\n5.3 Results and Analysis for LLM Prompt Engineering\nTable 7 shows the overall performance of the LLM-based experiments. The\nresults compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, with detailed\nper-category scores reported in Appendix D.\nThe results show that few-shot prompting often improve performance com-\npared to zero-shot prompting, though the effect is not consistent across models\nor categories. For instance, while Gemini 2.0 Pro’s overall Macro-F1 score rose\nfrom 0.830 to 0.889 with a few-shot approach, the score for Meta Llama 3 70b\nslightly decreased from 0.795 to 0.793. On category wise GPT-4o’s F1-score\nfor class V5 rose from 0.924 to 0.948 with few-shot prompting. However, this\nimprovement was not observed across all categories. For the difficult V12 class,\nMeta Llama 3 70b’s score actually dropped from 0.271 to 0.214 when examples\nwere added.\nContrary to expectations, larger models did not consistently gain more\nfrom few-shot prompting. In fact, the smaller Gemma 4b model saw its F1-\nscore on class V5 jump from 0.709 to 0.814. By contrast, the larger Gemma\n27b model’s performance on the same task decreased from 0.946 to 0.903. This\nshows that for this task, a larger model did not guarantee a greater benefit\nfrom few-shot examples.\nAll models showed weak performance on the underrepresented categories\nV6 and V12. Few-shot prompting offered limited benefit for these classes. For\nV6, DeepSeek R1 improved only marginally, from an F1-score of 0.117 to\n0.148. For V12, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest zero-shot score (0.605),\nbut dropped sharply to 0.335 with few-shot prompting, indicating that a small\nnumber of examples is insufficient to compensate for the severe class imbalance.\n5.4 Comparative Analysis of LLMs and Fine-Tuned BERT Models\nAs a point of reference, we included a Naive Baseline that always predicts the\nmost frequent class. As shown in Table 7, the model achieves a Weighted-F1', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation of Model Challenges and Prompt Engineering Strategies**: This chunk discusses the challenges faced by models, particularly with underrepresented OWASP ASVS categories like V6 (Stored Cryptography) and V12 (File and Resources), and outlines the experimental setup for LLM prompt engineering, including zero-shot and few-shot configurations, persona-based prompting, and strategies to mitigate prompt sensitivity and contextual bias.\n\nCONTENT: 26 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nshowed both low Recall (0.658) and low Precision (0.781), indicating it was\nboth missing true cases and incorrectly labeling other requirements as V6.\nModels struggle significantly with underrepresented categories, particularly\nV12 (File and Resources) and V6 (Stored Cryptography). This is evident in\nthe high number of false negatives, where the models fail to identify true\ninstances of these classes. For example, the baseline BERT model incorrectly\nclassified over half of the V12 requirements as negative (14 false negatives vs.\n13 true positives). Conversely, the matrices show that models often misclassify\nrequirements by incorrectly assigning them to other categories. The BERT\nBase model, for example, incorrectly labeled 92 different requirements as V10\n(Malicious Code) and 78 requirements as V5 (Malicious Input Handling).\n5.2 Experimental Setup for LLM Prompt Engineering\nWe adapted prompt engineering strategies from Ronanki (Ronanki et al.,\n2024), originally used for multi-class requirement classification. Two configu-\nrations were evaluated: zero-shot prompting (Appendix A), which relied solely\non task instructions and the input requirement, and few-shot prompting (Ap-\npendix B), which additionally incorporated labeled examples. The few-shot\nsetup used 30 training instances that were chosen to (i) capture multi-label\ncases where a single requirement spans multiple security categories, (ii) cover\nall 11 OWASP ASVS categories, and (iii) reflect requirements from different\nbusiness domains to preserve linguistic variation.\nPersona-based prompting was applied in both configurations by instruct-\ning the model to act as an experienced cybersecurity specialist. This alignment\nhelped reduce output variance by grounding responses in professional domain\nexpertise rather than general conversational patterns. The final prompt was\nobtained after five iterations. These iterations focused on three primary ar-\neas: (1) instruction clarity to prevent the model from defaulting to binary\nsecurity labels; (2) contextual grounding, by iteratively refining the OWASP\nASVS category definitions to ensure the model adhered to provided standards;\n(3) constraint formatting, to stabilize the PSV output structure for machine-\nreadability and ensure the inclusion of mandatory explanation fields. All ex-\nperiments were conducted with fixed parameters (Temperature = 0, Top-p =\n0.95) and repeated three times. The reported results are averaged to reduce\nthe impact of any minor, non-deterministic fluctuations in the models’ token\nselection during individual inferences.\nPrompt-based methods can be sensitive to phrasing, structure, and exam-\nple selection. To manage prompt sensitivity and contextual bias, we adopted a\nunified Persona–Context–Constraint strategy. A single prompt structure was\nused across all models, without model-specific tuning or iterative optimization\naimed at maximizing scores. The few-shot examples were chosen for representa-\ntiveness with respect to the OWASP ASVS taxonomy rather than performance\ngains.', 'CONTEXT: **Comparison of Fine-Tuned Transformers and LLMs for Security Requirements Classification**  \nThis chunk discusses the performance comparison between fine-tuned transformer models and few-shot prompting with LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.0), highlighting their near-equal effectiveness in classifying implicit security requirements within the ASRD dataset, while emphasizing the challenges of integrating security early in the SDLC through the ""Shift-Left"" approach.\n\nCONTENT: 2 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\ntional fine-tuned transformer models and contemporary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) employing few-shot and zero-shot prompt engineering strategies.\nThe results show that a few-shot prompting with Gemini 2.0 achieves a macro-\naverage F1 score of 0.941, directly comparable to the fine-tuned BERT model’s\n0.942. This study culminates in two primary findings: first, the validation and\npublication of the ASRD, a high-granularity, multi-label dataset for implicit\nsecurity requirements based on OWASP ASVS V2-V13; and second, the di-\nrect comparison demonstrating that few-shot Large Language Models (LLMs)\nachieve competitive multi-label classification performance (Macro-F1 0.941)\nnearly equal to resource-intensive fine-tuned transformer models (Macro-F1\n0.942). This confirms that LLMs represent a highly practical and resource-\nsaving strategy for automating the identification of embedded (implicit) secu-\nrity requirements for software security in industrial SRS documents\nKeywordsCybersecurity requirement elicitation·OWASP based security\nrequirement classification·OWASP ASVS-based Requirement Labeling·\nLLM based classification\n1 Introduction\nRequirements Engineering (RE) concerns the identification, documentation,\nand management of software requirements (Sommerville and Sawyer, 1997).\nThe increasing interconnectivity of information systems forces organizations\nto provide secure services in cyberspace. Integrating security during initial\nrequirements analysis is essential to proactively mitigate risks, reduce vulner-\nabilities, and reduce the high costs associated with downstream remediation\n(Villamizar et al., 2018). This proactive approach is central to the ”Shift-\nLeft” security paradigm, which advocates for the identification and mitigation\nof vulnerabilities as early as possible in the Software Development Life Cycle\n(SDLC).\nAlthough Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) has matured as a dis-\ncipline, its effective application in practice remains challenging. The issue is\nnot the absence of security considerations, but the difficulty of ensuring that\nsecurity requirements are properly validated and verified. An empirical investi-\ngation that combines a systematic literature review with a survey of 58 indus-\ntry professionals highlights this gap (Alam et al., 2025). While practitioners\nreported a moderate understanding of SRE practices, Security Requirements\nAssurance (SRA) was found to be poorly understood and rarely applied in\nindustrial contexts. The study concludes that validating and ensuring security\nrequirements remains a major and unresolved challenge in practice.\nThis assurance gap persists due to the documented lack of specialized se-\ncurity training for developers in early-phase RE (Andrade et al., 2023). The\ntask relies heavily on scarce specialized expertise and time-intensive manual\nanalysis. The main challenge is that critical security requirements are often not\nexplicitly stated. Instead, they are implicitly embedded within standard func-\ntional descriptions. For example, a seemingly simple functional requirement,']","The key limitation of static few-shot prompting observed in the study is its inability to generalize well for minority or underrepresented classes. The study highlights that providing a fixed set of 1–3 examples often yields inconsistent gains and, in some cases, even degrades performance compared to zero-shot prompting. This is particularly evident for rare, high-variance security classes, where static prompts fail to capture the context-dependent nature of implicit requirements. For example, a fixed example related to ""file upload"" in class V12 does not help the model identify a V12 requirement related to ""directory traversal,"" leading to low F1-scores (0.077–0.172) for these classes. This confirms that static prompting is insufficient for handling rare and diverse security requirements.

What role did the 'senior SME' play in the annotation process?,"['CONTEXT: This chunk details the multi-stage annotation process used to create the ASRD dataset, including expert adjudication for contested items, the handling of class imbalances in security requirement categories (e.g., Stored Cryptography and File Handling), and the inclusion of true negatives to ensure realistic model evaluation.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 17\n0.71 to 0.79, further confirmed substantial agreement between individual\nannotator pairs.\n–Adjudication: Disagreements were resolved through structured expert dis-\ncussions led by the senior SME.

If not,\nthe senior expert led a discussion to decide.\n–Final decision and the reason was written down.\nThe goal was to reach unanimous agreement for each disputed requirement.\nThis process produced final Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested\nitems, ensuring consistency and validation of the dataset.\nThis multi-stage annotation methodology produced a reliable dataset which\ncomprises 2,652 annotated security-relevant requirements. The category dis-\ntributions of the requirements can be seen in Figure 1. The class distribution\namong the classes are largely balanced (90%) except the V6(Stored Cryptog-\nraphy) and V12 (Files & Resources) as 6% each. This imbalance is considered\na reflection of the source projects, where requirements for these two categories\nare inherently less frequent than pervasive controls like access control or input\nvalidation. Stored cryptography requirements are typically captured as holis-\ntic, architectural decisions rather than numerous, distinct functional require-\nments. Similarly, explicit security controls for file handling are less ubiquitous,\nappearing only in projects with specific file processing features, which explains\ntheir low frequency in our corpus. Sample annotated requirements can be seen\nin Table 4.\nThis imbalance mirrors real-world security requirement frequency - most\nsoftware functions involve access and data; few involve file uploads or encryp-\ntion configuration - and introduces a challenge for machine learning. Partic-\nularly, the sparsity in V6 and V12 categories may hinder generalization and\ncalls for class imbalance handling techniques. Despite this, the dataset presents\na realistic and high-quality foundation for developing and evaluating security-\naware NLP and classification models.\nTwenty-six requirements (0.98% of the data) labeled as “UNASSIGNED”\nwere requirements unanimously determined by the experts to be purely func-\ntional requirements with no discernible implicit security component (e.g., “The\nsystem will enable application software to be developed with an object-oriented\nprogramming approach”,). These items were intentionally retained in the dataset\nas true negatives to ensure a realistic distribution and test the models’ ability\nto correctly reject non-security items.\n\n18 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nFig. 1: Distribution of Classes', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD, following the MATTER cycle framework.

Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase.

For the annotation process, a sample\ncorpus from the requirement set has been selected by inter agreement of\nSMEs. The first version of the Annotation Guideline based on OWASP\nASVS security classes has been developed, where each annotator has in-\ndividually classified the sample corpus by annotating it with one or more\nlabels following the instructions provided in the first Annotation Guide-\nline. After the initial annotation, the SMEs met under the guidance of the\nsenior SME, who is also the branch manager, to review and discuss the\nannotation decisions. Each of the 30 software requirements was examined\nindividually, and in cases where there were differing opinions among the\nannotators, efforts were made to persuade and convince others by provid-\ning explanations and reasons for their choices. After three iterations of\ndiscussions and deliberations, a full agreement was reached for 30 software\nrequirements.\n–Pilot Annotation: An initial batch of 30 software requirements was anno-\ntated early in the study, prompting multiple discussion rounds and three\nupdates to the guidelines. Adjudication meetings enabled the resolution\nof non-consensus requirements through SME-led discussions, during which\nthe rationale for classification was articulated. Discrepancies arising from\nquality issues, such as guideline violations, were addressed by implement-\ning corrections to ensure conformity with established criteria. Each SME\nprovided justifications for their decisions, which facilitated informed dis-\ncussions and enhanced understanding during adjudication. This iterative\nprocess resolved discrepancies across 98 requirements throughout the entire\ncorpus and was important in establishing the finalized annotation frame-\nwork.\n–Independent Annotation: Each SME classified all remaining 2622 require-\nments independently, using the finalized guideline. Annotators were re-\nquired to justify each decision. This practice proved important for facili-\ntating informed discussions and understanding annotator reasoning during\nthe subsequent adjudication phase. The process took 284 days and 267\nperson-hours of expert time.\n–Agreement Metrics: Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) was calculated us-\ning Fleiss’s Kappa and pairwise Cohen’s Kappa to assess consistency.

To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases.

We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility.

Setup Effort Best Macro-F1\nBERT Fine-Tuning High (∼2,600 ex) High (267 hours)0.942\nLLM Few-Shot Low (∼30 ex) Low (<10 hours)0.941\nLLM Zero-Shot None Minimal (<2 hours) 0.890\nLLM Few-Shot approach (using Gemini 2.0) achieved a similar performance\n(Macro-F1 0.941) while requiring only the selection of a small number of in-\ncontext examples (approx. 30 examples per prompt).\nThis comparison points to diminishing returns from large-scale annotation\nwhen capable LLMs are available. Although extensive annotation was required\nhere to establish a reliable ground truth and validate the test set, the results\nindicate that, in industrial settings, a few-shot LLM approach can offer a more\nfavorable balance between effort and accuracy. Comparable performance can\nbe reached with substantially less data preparation, reducing the need for\nprolonged expert annotation.\nThe main contribution of this work is the introduction and validation of\nthe ASRD. The consistent performance of both fine-tuned BERT models and\nLLM-based approaches on ASRD supports its reliability and practical value.\nThe dataset addresses a persistent limitation in SRE research which is the\nlack of large, well-curated, professionally sourced benchmarks for security re-\nquirement classification. Compared with existing datasets, ASRD offers sev-\neral advantages. Unlike DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023), which is derived\nfrom student projects, ASRD includes 2,652 requirements from six commer-\ncial software systems, reflecting real industrial language and complexity. Its\nOWASP ASVS–based taxonomy spans 11 security classes, providing finer de-\ntail than PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), where security is treated as a\nsingle category. Although the healthcare dataset by Riaz et al. (Riaz et al.,\n2014) is larger, it focuses on six broad objectives within a single domain, lim-\niting its scope. By contrast, ASRD supports cross-domain analysis and aligns\nwith a framework widely used in practice.\nThe dataset also benefits from a rigorous annotation process. Three cy-\nbersecurity specialists, each with over 15 years of experience, labeled the data\nusing an iterative MATTER-based procedure. This resulted in strong agree-\nment (Fleiss’ Kappa = 0.82) and helps mitigate the subjectivity that often\naffects security-related requirement datasets.\nBeyond the dataset construction, this study highlights the complexity of\nimplicit security requirement elicitation. A significant portion of security vul-\nnerabilities stems not from missing explicit security constraints (e.g., “The\nsystem shall encrypt passwords”), but from functional requirements that im-\nplicitly demand robust security controls. Our analysis of the ASRD reveals\nthat functional descriptions of business logic often conceal a dense network of\nsecurity dependencies. A representative example from our results is Require-\nment No. 2 (“The system will carry out the asset handover process”). While']","The 'senior SME' played a critical role in the annotation process by leading the adjudication of disagreements between annotators. Specifically, their responsibilities included:

1. **Facilitating Structured Discussions**: When annotators disagreed on a requirement, the senior SME led structured discussions where both annotators presented their choices and reasoning.
2. **Guideline Review and Decision-Making**: The senior SME reviewed the annotators' positions against the annotation guidelines. If the guidelines clearly supported one choice, that decision was adopted. If not, the senior SME facilitated further discussions to reach a consensus.
3. **Finalizing Annotations**: The senior SME ensured that a unanimous agreement was reached for each disputed requirement. The final decision and its rationale were documented to maintain consistency and validation.
4. **Oversight and Quality Assurance**: Beyond adjudication, the senior SME provided feedback to improve the annotation guidelines and ensured the overall quality and clarity of the process.

This process was instrumental in producing the Gold Standard annotations for 135 contested items, ensuring the dataset's reliability and consistency.

1. **Authentication (V2)**:  
   - Asset handover often involves verifying the identity of the user or entity involved in the process. This ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can initiate or complete the handover.  
   - For example, verifying the identity of the user handing over or receiving the asset is critical to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

2. **Access Control (V4)**:  
   - Asset handover requires enforcing strict access controls to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can access or transfer the asset.  
   - This aligns with the principle of least privilege, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access or manipulate the asset during the handover process.

These classifications are consistent with the OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 definitions, where **Authentication (V2)** focuses on verifying identities, and **Access Control (V4)** ensures that users can only access data and functions for which they are explicitly authorized. The study likely used these categories to emphasize the importance of secure identity verification and role-based access management in asset handover scenarios.

What is the 'Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework' proposed for future work?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: Acknowledgments, Funding, and Ethical Declarations: This chunk provides details on the funding sources, ethical considerations, author contributions, and data availability for the study, emphasizing transparency and the collaborative efforts of subject matter experts in annotating the ASRD dataset.\n\nCONTENT: 38 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nASRD into English.

These concerns correspond\nto common security control areas, such as access control, session management,\nand logging. This complexity requires substantial guidance. Manually iden-\ntifying and validating this network of implicit security dependencies across\nthousands of requirements is error prone, inconsistent, and not scalable (Ye\net al., 2025).\nGiven the limitations of manual SRA, automation through Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, offers a\npromising path forward. Although AI based approaches for RE have received\ngrowing attention (Abbasi et al., 2025; Zadenoori et al., 2025), recent evidence\nshows a gap between experimental advances and validated industrial solutions.\nFor example, an analysis of 74 primary studies found that most AI based tools\nare evaluated in controlled settings, with limited industrial adoption and weak\nintegration into real workflows (Bolanos et al., 2024). Similarly, another study\nreports a clear mismatch between expectations and practical outcomes in SRE\nin real world use (Karhu et al., 2025).\nThe main problem is the lack of suitable data, not the availability of ef-\nfective modeling approaches. The development and validation of data driven\napproaches is constrained by the scarcity and limited quality of domain spe-\ncific datasets (Wang et al., 2024; Zadenoori et al., 2025). This concern ex-\ntends beyond SRE, as leading NLP venues highlight dataset limitations that\nmake reliable evaluation difficult (Muresan et al., 2022; Goldberg et al., 2022;\nChristodoulopoulos et al., 2025).\nThis challenge is especially evident in SRE. Identifying implicit security\nrequirements relies on large collections of functional requirements annotated\nby security experts to reflect underlying security concerns. Current datasets do\nnot meet this need. For instance, PROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019) includes\nonly a single, high-level security category; DOSSPRE (Kadebu et al., 2023)\nis based on student projects and lacks industry realism; and the Healthcare\ndataset (Riaz et al., 2014) is limited to a narrow domain and uses coarse-\ngrained labels. As a result, existing resources offer limited support for devel-\noping and evaluating methods aimed at uncovering implicit security require-\nments.\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)1 offers a\nstandardized, systematic, and verifiable framework for defining and evaluating\napplication security controls. ASVS emphasizes the principle of “security by\ndesign” by facilitating the integration of security considerations early in the\nsoftware development lifecycle. Its comprehensive set of requirements can be\ndirectly mapped to verifiable test cases and secure coding practices, ensuring\ntraceability throughout the development process.

Its main contribution is the Agency Security Requirements Dataset\n(ASRD), a publicly available corpus created to support research in automated\nSRA. The ASRD comprises:\n–Real-World Data: 2,652 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) sen-\ntences extracted from six diverse, real-world industry projects,\n–Expert Annotation: Meticulously annotated by three cybersecurity experts,\neach with over 15 years of industry experience,\n–Rigorous Methodology: Developed using the iterative MATTER cycle an-\nnotation framework (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012),\n–High Granularity and Multi-label Structure: Mapped to 11 distinct, action-\nable security categories from the industry-standard OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS,V2–V13), allowing each require-\nment to be associated with multiple categories.\nThe ASRD is intended as a shared research resource and benchmark. Using\nthis dataset, the study conducts an empirical analysis of automated classifica-\ntion approaches and addresses the following research questions:\n1. To what extent can fine-tuned transformer models accurately perform\nmulti-label classification of implicit security requirements into OWASP\nASVS categories using the ASRD?\n2. How does the performance of prompt-based approaches (zero-shot and few-\nshot) using modern LLMs compare to fine-tuned BERT-based models and\nnaive baselines for this task?\nThe results show that few-shot prompting with a modern language model\n(Gemini 2.0) achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.941, closely matching the\nbest fine-tuned BERT-based model (0.942). This demonstrates that example-\nguided inference can reach performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning\nwhile requiring substantially less annotated data and model retraining. The\nevaluation compares fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., SecureBERT) with\nprompt-based methods in zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple con-\ntemporary models, demonstrating that prompt-based approaches provide a\npractical and resource-efficient alternative for identifying implicit security re-\nquirements in industrial SRS documents.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Our proposed Agency Security Require-\nments Dataset (ASRD) addresses gaps in prior work by adopting the OWASP\nASVS taxonomy for multi-label annotation. Furthermore, by utilizing real-\nworld projects originally written in Turkish, ASRD introduces both industrial\ncomplexity and linguistic diversity to the field.\n3 Dataset Curation, Annotation, and Evaluation\n3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing\nThe dataset compilation began with the collection of six Software Require-\nments Specification (SRS) documents from an Agency’s Security Department.\nThese documents were selected from an initial pool of 19 projects executed\nbetween 2019 and 2023, specifically chosen for their domain diversity and\namenability to effective anonymization. The original documents were provided\nin standard document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) where requirements were\norganized in itemized lists. To transform these documents into a machine-\nreadable dataset, we employed a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:\n1. Sentence Segmentation and Extraction: As the source SRS documents uti-\nlized standard itemization for requirements, we employed a rule-based ex-\ntraction method. We utilized pattern matching to identify requirement\nblocks based on hierarchical numbering schemes and line breaks. Each iden-\ntified requirement was extracted and treated as a single processing unit,\npreserving the structural integrity of the original specification.\n2. Anonymization: To protect sensitive data, a semi-automated anonymiza-\ntion process was implemented. Custom scripts replaced entities such as\nproject names, specific URLs, and IP addresses with generic placeholders.\nThis was followed by a manual review by domain experts to ensure that\nthe removal of personally identifiable information (PII) did not compromise\nthe semantic meaning or contextual integrity of the requirements.', 'CONTEXT: **Contextual Header:** This chunk provides a background on prior work in NLP-based techniques for software requirements classification, highlighting the evolution from traditional supervised learning methods to advanced transformer-based models like BERT and SecureBERT, and discussing the challenges of classifying implicit security requirements due to their abstract nature and reliance on domain expertise.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 5\nthreats to validity, and Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions\nand directions for future work.\n2 Background\nThis section reviews prior work on NLP-based techniques for requirements\nclassification, followed by an overview of relevant security frameworks. It con-\ncludes with a discussion of existing datasets used in security requirements\nresearch.\n2.1 Related Work on Requirements Classification using NLP Techniques\nSoftware requirements (SR) classification supports effective project manage-\nment by enabling prioritization and risk assessment (Batool et al., 2025). The\ntask typically involves distinguishing functional requirements (FRs) from non-\nfunctional requirements (NFRs) and further categorizing NFRs into classes\nsuch as security, usability, and performance. Security requirements may ap-\npear as explicit system behaviors or as quality attributes addressing confiden-\ntiality, integrity, and availability—the security triad—which are often abstract\nand difficult to specify precisely in practice (Anwar Mohammad et al., 2019).\nThis inherent ambiguity complicates the development of clear guidelines for\nseparating security-related requirements from non-security ones.\nEarly studies applied supervised learning techniques, including Bayesian\nclassifiers(Knauss et al., 2011), decision trees (Jindal et al., 2016), and Sup-\nport Vector Machines (SVMs) (Dalpiaz et al., 2019), but these approaches\ndepended heavily on manual feature engineering and rigid linguistic patterns.\nTo address these limitations, later work adopted neural models such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Word2Vec embeddings (Dekht-\nyar and Fong, 2017). The adoption of transformer-based models such as BERT\nenabled improved classification accuracy through transfer learning and fine-\ntuning, eliminating the need for handcrafted features (Devlin et al., 2019; Sub-\nahi, 2023). More recent work explores domain-adapted transformer models,\nsuch as NoRBERT (Hey et al., 2020) and SecureBERT (Aghaei et al., 2022),\nto better capture domain-specific semantics and mitigate overfitting. These\nmodels have shown improved capability in identifying implicit non-functional\nrequirements, a particularly challenging task in security-critical settings (Nec-\nula et al., 2024). However, further progress in SRE is limited by the availability\nof large, high-quality, and domain-specific annotated datasets.\nThe subjective nature of defining security requirements further complicates\nreliable classification (Riaz and Williams, 2012). Security Requirement Elic-\nitation highly depends on domain-relevant expertise which includes various\ncostly manual steps such as creating security requirement templates, deter-\nmining security classification levels according to natural language artifacts,\nand mapping the class labels to related requirement templates by identifying\nentities.', 'CONTEXT: This chunk details the annotation methodology and dataset curation process for the ASRD, following the MATTER cycle framework. It emphasizes the selection of expert annotators, corpus preparation through anonymization, and the iterative development of annotation guidelines based on OWASP ASVS categories to ensure consistency and accuracy in classifying implicit security requirements.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 15\n3.3 Annotation Methodology (MATTER Cycle) & Dataset Curation\nThe annotation process followed the MATTER development cycle, an estab-\nlished iterative framework for corpus annotation (Pustejovsky and Stubbs,\n2012). Crucially, the annotation task was defined as a multi-label text classifi-\ncation problem. It consists of the phases Model, Annotate, Train, Test, Eval-\nuate, and Revise. The annotation guidelines were developed and iteratively\nrefined to ensure consistency and clarity.\nThe Model–Annotate cycle involved writing guidelines, selecting annota-\ntors, conducting trial annotations, and refining the process. Once stabilized,\nthis cycle was expanded to the full dataset to generate a Gold Standard corpus.\nThe annotation workflow included the following processes:\n–Annotator Selection: Following Bayerl and Paul’s recommendation to use\ndomain-aligned annotators (Bayerl and Paul, 2011), three cybersecurity\nsubject matter experts (SME) from the agency, each with over 15 years\nof experience in designing security architectures, analyzing threat models,\nand identifying security requirements, performed the annotations. Their\ndeep practical experience ensured accurate and context-aware interpreta-\ntion which aligned with the requirement “experts must demonstrate signif-\nicant skills, knowledge, and experience” emphasized by Hopkins (Hopkins\nand Unger, 2017). The senior manager among them also provided over-\nsight and led the adjudication process. The senior SME acted as both an\nannotator and the final adjudicator for resolving disagreements. They also\nprovided feedback to improve the quality and clarity of the annotation\nguideline.\n–Corpus Selection and Preparation: Cohen (Cohen et al., 2005) recommends\nthat during corpus design, balance and representativeness of the corpus\nis important. In line with his recommendation, of the 19 initial project\ndocuments, six were chosen for their domain diversity and potential for\neffective anonymization by the SMEs. These documents underwent a semi-\nautomated anonymization process to remove all project-specific and per-\nsonally identifiable information (PII). The process targeted entities such\nas names of individuals and organizations, project codenames, and specific\ntechnical identifiers. This was done using custom scripts with placeholder\nreplacement, followed by manual review to ensure that anonymization did\nnot alter the meaning, structure, or intent of the original requirements. The\nextracted requirements were then randomized and masked to prevent po-\ntential bias related to document origin or sequence during the annotation\nphase. Total corpus has 2,652 requirements (30 pilot + 2,622 independent\nannotations).\n–Annotation Guideline Development: The Annotation Guidelines’ develop-\nment involved an initial iterative process, refining the guidelines three times\nto resolve ambiguities before the formal assessment phase.

What method is proposed to improve the evaluation of model generalizability in future studies?,"['CONTEXT: **Proposed Future Directions for Addressing Dataset Sparsity and Improving Classification Accuracy:** This chunk outlines three key algorithmic advancements—Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with RAG, a Human-AI Collaborative Framework, and Synthetic Data Injection—to tackle challenges like class imbalance and rare security requirements, while also suggesting improved evaluation methods for model generalizability.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 37\ntime. This approach effectively substitutes the need for dense in-context ex-\namples with explicit external standards, ensuring accurate classification for\nrare security events where traditional fine-tuning or few-shot prompting fails.\nConsequently, this study suggests that future NLP research in SRE cannot\nrely solely on organic dataset expansion. To overcome this inherent sparsity,\nwe propose as future work three targeted algorithmic advancements:\n1. Dynamic Few-Shot Selection with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):\nSystems might dynamically retrieve the explicit definitions and verifica-\ntion criteria from standards like OWASP ASVS to ground their classifi-\ncation of rare requirements. Future work should implement RAG for Dy-\nnamic Prompting in agentic approach. Instead of fixed examples, a retriever\nshould select thekmost semantically similar valid requirements from the\ntraining set to serve as in-context examples for the specific query. This\nensures the LLM is grounded with relevant architectural patterns (e.g.,\n“encryption” vs. “hashing”) rather than generic class examples.\n2. Human-AI Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework: A promising direction\nfor future work is a Human-in-the-Loop multi-agent framework that com-\nbines automated classification with targeted expert oversight for ambigu-\nous or high-risk cases. In this setup, a retrieval-augmented agent would\ndynamically select the most relevant annotated requirements using seman-\ntic similarity, replacing static few-shot examples. A second agent would\nassess classification confidence and consistency, flagging unclear cases and\nrequesting focused clarifications from a human expert when needed. A su-\npervisor agent would then consolidate these inputs and ensure that the\nfinal labels remain consistent with the OWASP ASVS taxonomy and the\nbroader project context. In parallel, an optimization agent would learn from\nhuman interventions to refine retrieval strategies and prompting over time,\nreducing manual effort while improving accuracy on challenging security\nrequirements.\n3. Synthetic Data Injection (for Supervised Models): To address the sparsity\nhindering BERT-based fine-tuning, we recommend a Teacher-Student Data\nGeneration loop. High-reasoning LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\nshould be used to generate diverse synthetic requirements that implicitly\ntrigger V6/V12 classifications. These synthetic samples can populate the\ntraining set, allowing smaller supervised models (BERT) to learn robust\ndecision boundaries without requiring expensive manual annotation.\nAdditionally, future efforts should include a more stringent evaluation of\nmodel generalizability using a leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach.\nThis method involves training a model on requirements from five of the projects\nand testing it on the single, held-out project. Repeating this process for all six\nprojects would provide a much clearer and more realistic assessment of how\nwell these models perform on entirely new, unseen SRS documents, which is\na significant measure for real-world applicability.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between our current findings and the global\nresearch community, we plan to undertake a professional translation of the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges of class imbalance in security requirements classification, the impact of few-shot prompting on model performance, and the potential of hybrid approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve results, particularly for underrepresented security classes. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of LLMs with agent-based components to enhance automated security analysis.\n\nCONTENT: 36 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nfocus their efforts on high-risk adjudication rather than manual discovery. Our\nresults suggest that commercially available LLMs can serve as always-available\nassistants, democratizing high-level security analysis for development teams.\nFurthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of this tool on prac-\ntitioners with varying levels of experience. Specifically, research is needed to\ndetermine if such automation allows junior developers to identify security con-\ncerns more accurately or if it primarily eases the cognitive load for senior\nexperts by filtering out routine classifications.\nThis study highlights class imbalance as a persistent challenge in SRE.\nThe issue is not specific to ASRD but reflects the nature of the domain itself.\nIn typical specifications, references to architectural security concerns such as\ncryptographic storage or low-level file handling, occur far less often than user-\nfacing controls like authentication (V2) or access control (V4). This creates\na “long-tail” distribution where the most important security failures often\nreside in the least represented classes. Standard supervised learning and even\nfew-shot prompting struggle to generalize from such limited examples. This is\na well-documented issue in requirements datasets, including benchmarks like\nPROMISE exp (Lima et al., 2019), which also suffers from imbalanced classes.\nThe improvement from zero-shot to few-shot prompting shows the positive\nimpact of adding in-context examples. For example, Gemma 4b’s F1 score on\nclass V5 rose from 0.709 to 0.814 with only a small number of examples. This\ngain shows how limited, well-chosen examples can steer model behavior toward\nthe intended classification task. Similar observations have been reported in\nprior work across domains, where prompt design and example selection were\nshown to play a decisive role in task performance (Mann et al., 2020; Liu et al.,\n2023a).\n8 Conclusion and Future Work\nThis work examined the feasibility of automated security requirements classi-\nfication under realistic conditions, where requirements are implicit, unevenly\ndistributed across categories, and drawn from industrial settings rather than\ncurated benchmarks. By introducing ASRD and evaluating supervised and\nprompt-based methods on a shared benchmark, this work enables direct com-\nparison across approaches. The results show that few-shot prompting is suit-\nable when labeled data is limited, while fine-tuned models are better at han-\ndling rare security requirements.\nAs a future work, we plan to explore hybrid SRE approaches that combine\nLLMs with retrieval and agent-based components. In particular, improving\nperformance on underrepresented classes remains an open problem and may\nbenefit from targeted data augmentation, retrieval-augmented methods (RAG)\nsuch as those proposed by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025), or agent-based strategies.\nFor instance, instead of relying on learned patterns from non-existent training\nexamples, a RAG-enabled system can dynamically retrieve the specific veri-\nfication requirements and definitions relevant to the input text at inference', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in addressing class imbalance and reproducibility issues in the classification of implicit security requirements, highlighting the use of experimental LLMs for advanced reasoning and the trade-offs between dataset curation effort and model performance.\n\nCONTENT: Implicit Security Requirements Classification 33\nlacked prior experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotation,\nthis was addressed through focused training sessions to align their domain\nexpertise with the technical requirements of the MATTER cycle.\nVariations in model versions and dependencies (e.g., library updates) pose\nchallenges to reproducibility.\nA significant class imbalance, with categories like V6 and V12 severely\nunderrepresented, restricts model learning and generalization. To address this,\nextensive training, refined annotation protocols, iterative consensus-building,\nand detailed error analysis were employed.\nA significant challenge in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is the\nrapid pace of model iteration. In this study, we deliberately selected several\n“experimental” and “preview” models (specifically gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-\nexp-01-21, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05, and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17) along-\nside stable releases. The rationale for including these unversioned, experi-\nmental models was to benchmark the absolute state-of-the-art capabilities in\n“reasoning” (Chain-of-Thought) and architectural efficiency that are not yet\npresent in General Availability (GA) versions at the time of the study. We\nhypothesized that the improved reasoning capabilities of models like Flash-\nThinking would be particularly advantageous for identifying implicit security\nrequirements, which often require multi-step deduction rather than simple pat-\ntern matching.\nHowever, we acknowledge that the use of experimental endpoints poses a\nthreat to internal validity regarding reproducibility. These models are subject\nto deprecation or unannounced updates by the provider, meaning other re-\nsearchers may not be able to query the exact same model weights in the future.\nTo mitigate this, we have documented the exact model identifier strings used\nduring our data collection window. While this does not guarantee future ac-\ncess to these specific snapshots, it ensures transparency regarding the specific\ntechnological generation evaluated. We argue that this trade-off is necessary\nto provide a forward-looking analysis of how emerging LLM capabilities (such\nas intrinsic reasoning) impact the field of Security Requirements Engineering.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined experimental results obtained from fine-tuning BERT models\nand employing various LLM prompting strategies, further refined by the com-\nparison between zero-shot and few-shot methods, yield several key insights.\nAn important dimension of our comparison is the trade-off between the ef-\nfort required to curate the dataset and the resulting classification performance.\nAs detailed in Section 3, the construction of the ASRD involved 267 person-\nhours of expert labor to annotate 2,652 requirements. This extensive effort\nwas a prerequisite for the fine-tuned BERT models, which rely on large-scale\nsupervised data.\nAs summarized in Table 9, the BERT Fine-Tuning approach achieved the\nhighest performance (Macro-F1 0.942) but at the highest cost. In contrast, the', 'CONTEXT: This chunk discusses the performance gap between majority and minority classes in security requirements classification, highlighting the challenges of addressing the ""Long Tail"" problem in imbalanced datasets.

This was mit-\nigated through the iterative MATTER cycle which includes training, iterative\nguideline refinement, and consensus-based adjudication.\nA key threat to internal validity is subjectivity as classifications rely heavily\non the latent domain knowledge and industry experience, rather than explicit\nindicators within the requirement text itself. This expert-driven approach pro-\nvides a “gold standard” for realistic industrial needs but it may introduce in-\nconsistencies if replicated by annotators with different backgrounds or if the\nbroader system context is not explicitly documented.\nThe test set was manually selected to balance computational efficiency and\ngeneralizability assessment. While cross-validation could improve test calibra-\ntion, it was avoided due to its high computational cost.\nTo minimize researcher bias and ensure the results reflect real-world in-\ndustry needs, domain experts used for the selection of both the test set and\nthe LLM suite.

For instance, deep learning\napproaches such as BiLSTMs have been used to detect re-entrancy vulnerabil-\nities in smart contracts, where generic models are insufficient (Maturi et al.,\n2025). This work highlights the importance of explainability, as security de-\ncisions must be understandable to support assurance and auditing. Although\nthis line of research addresses a different problem, it reflects a shift toward\ndomain-aware and interpretable models.\nTransformer-based models have enabled new capabilities in automated text\nunderstanding(Zhou et al., 2025). They possess emergent abilities like in-\ncontext learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Zhu et al.,\n2025), which allow them to perform complex tasks, including requirements\nclassification, with minimal or no labeled data (Liu et al., 2023b; Zhu et al.,\n2025). Recent trends show a growing interest in applying LLMs to RE tasks,\nincluding requirements classification, prioritization, and traceability (Rajbhoj\net al., 2024; White et al., 2024). LLMs can perform zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, reducing the need for large annotated datasets and facilitating adap-\ntation to specialized domains like SRE (Labrak et al., 2023). Techniques such\nas prompt engineering and integration with external knowledge bases (e.g.,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation) further improve their performance and con-\ntextual relevance (Masoudifard et al., 2024).\nLLM-assisted security solutions typically follow a three-step process: pre-\nprocessing (extracting context like documentation or target units), prompt\ngeneration (using instructions and unfilled slots for the model to complete\nwith artifacts like fuzz drivers or patches), and post-processing (validating\noutputs, e.g., checking if generated code successfully compiles) (Zhu et al.,\n2025).\nWhile these models provide powerful automation, they can also introduce\nnew risks and errors if applied without careful oversight. This underscores the\nneed for realistic, high-quality datasets and standardized evaluation frame-\nworks to reliably assess automated security requirement classification, ensuring\nboth effectiveness and safety in practice.\nThe use of automated models in security highlights both their potential and\nthe risks they can introduce. Ensuring accurate and reliable classification of\nsecurity requirements requires evaluation against high-quality, domain-specific\nbenchmarks (Jeong, 2024). This underscores the need for realistic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation frameworks tailored to SRE.\n2.2 Related Work on Security Frameworks\nAn appropriate security framework is necessary to ensure systematic and con-\nsistent identification and classification of security requirements, particularly in\nautomated settings. This section reviews widely adopted security frameworks\nand evaluates their suitability for requirement analysis.', 'CONTEXT: **Evaluation Protocol and BERT-Based Model Classification**: This chunk details the experimental methodology for evaluating fine-tuned BERT models and LLMs in classifying implicit security requirements, including data partitioning, performance metrics, and the transfer learning approach used to adapt pre-trained BERT models for the task.\n\nCONTENT: 20 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\n4 Implicit Security Requirements Classification Methodology\nThis section presents the experiment protocol used to assess the two research\nquestions regarding the performance of fine-tuned BERT variant models in\nclassification of requirements statements and LLM models with zero and few-\nshot prompting.\n4.1 Evaluation Protocol and Data Usage\nThe dataset was split into training (70%, n=1,856), validation (15%, n=398),\nand test (15%, n=398) sets, with the validation set used for hyperparameter\ntuning and the test set reserved for final evaluation. Stratified sampling based\non security class labels was applied to preserve label distributions across all\nsplits. The test set was sized to include sufficient samples of minority classes\n(e.g., V6 and V12), while the training set remained large enough to support\neffective fine-tuning.\nAlthough zero-shot LLMs do not require data partitioning and few-shot\nsettings rely on only a small number of examples, the shared test set was\nretained to ensure a fair comparison between fine-tuned model variants and\nprompt-based LLM approaches.\nWe used a comprehensive suite of metrics for classification performance\nevaluation. We report Precision, which measures the accuracy of positive pre-\ndictions, and Recall, which measures the model’s ability to identify all rele-\nvant instances. The F1-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is\nused to provide a single measure balancing this trade-off. To assess overall\nperformance across all 11 security classes, we calculated the micro-averaged\nF1, which reflects aggregate accuracy, the macro-averaged F1, which assesses\nperformance by treating all classes equally regardless of their frequency, and\nthe weighted-averaged F1, which accounts for class support.\n4.2 Classification using BERT based Models\nWe conducted a comparative analysis using four distinct BERT-based mod-\nels to systematically evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies.\nThis approach allowed us to test hypotheses related to domain-specificity, lan-\nguage, and multilingualism, with the specific technical details of each model\nsummarized in Table 5.\nFor the classification task, we adopted a standard transfer learning ap-\nproach by adding a task-specific classification “head” on top of each pre-trained\nmodel. This head consists of a single fully-connected linear layer that maps\n8 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n9 https://huggingface.co/ehsanaghaei/SecureBERT\n10 https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n11 https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased', 'CONTEXT: **Optimization and Prompting Strategies for Model Performance**: This chunk discusses the optimization of BERT models through systematic grid search and early stopping to prevent overfitting, as well as the use of prompt engineering strategies for leveraging LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings without modifying model weights.\n\nCONTENT: 22 Yusuf G¨ ur et al.\nWe performed a systematic grid search using the Weights & Biases 12\nplatform to identify the optimal configuration for each BERT variant using\nthe validation dataset. The search space included the following parameters:\n–Maximum Sequence Length:[128, 256]tokens\n–Batch Size:[4, 8, 16]\n–Number of Epochs:[16, 24, 32]\n–Learning Rate:[1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5]\n–Decision Threshold:[0.3, 0.4, 0.5]\nTo prevent overfitting, we monitored validation loss and implemented early\nstopping with a patience of 2–4 epochs. The checkpoint achieving the lowest\nvalidation loss for each model was selected for the final evaluation on the test\nset.\n4.3 Classification using LLM Models\nLLMs are transformer-based models trained on massive corpora for general-\npurpose natural language understanding and generation. This study adopted\nthe “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm, which replaces traditional\n“pre-train, fine-tune” approaches (Liu et al., 2023a). Rather than adjusting\nthe model’s objective or architecture, prompt engineering is used to steer the\nmodel toward task-specific outputs through carefully designed textual inputs.\nPrompt engineering involves designing prompts that elicit accurate re-\nsponses for specific tasks. In zero-shot prompting, an LLM is directly used\nwithout any task-specific training. Few-shot prompting introduces a small\nnumber of labeled examples in the prompt, which allows the model to learn\nthe task pattern. This is particularly beneficial when labeled training data is\nlimited.\nFour main prompting strategies were proposed by (Liu et al., 2023a):\n–Tuning-free prompting: Requires no model changes, suitable for zero-shot\nsettings, but often demands complex prompt design.\n–Fixed-LLM prompt tuning: Involves learning soft prompts while keep-\ning the model fixed; effective for few-shot tasks but typically lacks inter-\npretability.\n–Fixed-prompt LLM tuning: Fine-tunes the model on a fixed prompt; im-\nproves performance in few-shot settings.\n–Prompt + LLM tuning: Jointly tunes both model and prompts; highly\nexpressive but prone to overfitting on small datasets.\nIn this study, we evaluated the first two of these strategies, as they do\nnot require modification of the base LLM’s weights. For our zero-shot experi-\nments, we implemented tuning-free prompting, relying on carefully engineered\nprompts to guide the models. For our few-shot analysis, our approach aligns\n12 https://wandb.ai/site']","The proposed method to improve the evaluation of model generalizability in future studies is the use of a **leave-one-project-out cross-validation approach**.
